Female,a,BCG,Hold,"The interaction involving a game with tokens and players A and B reminds me of the strategic decision-making often required in real-life scenarios, such as business negotiations or competitive situations. It's akin to the delicate balance between collaboration and competition that we encounter when trying to achieve personal goals while navigating interpersonal relationships and external factors. Just like in the game, real-life success often hinges on observing others, adapting to changing circumstances, and making decisions that serve both immediate and long-term objectives."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,Lending somebody money and not having assurance he will pay you back the money
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"Well, i see it kinda like stocks, in wich as longer as you hold to them, you get a bigger payout when evventually you decide to sell. Long term deals tend to be better in my point of view, due to interest"
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me, in a general way, of any human interaction. It's also comparable to exams; if you pass, both the student and the teacher benefit. On one hand, the student gains by passing the subject and continuing their learning, and on the other hand, the teacher benefits from having taught well, the satisfaction of their students learning, and the percentage of students passing, which contributes to their success as a teacher."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,If two people have to decide how things go they need to be on the same page 
Female,a,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of making investments for the future hence I decided to pass in my decision.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of gambling where you have to take a risk in hopes that you'll receive a higher return, and I think the study is trying to capture risk taking behaviour."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,am not sure but i think this blockchain or crypto or bitcoin because is the only thing that depend on being traded to increase value but if all of us we chose to hold then there is appreciation in value. 
Male,a,BCG,Hold,This is more about poker and gambling. There is also a factor of trust with the player. 
Female,a,BCG,Hold,You are gambling with tokens on whether the other person will hold or invest. You can't read someones mind so you have to trust your gut instinct and hope they have chosen similar to yourself.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It somewhat reminds me of working where the effort the boss gives is passed to the worker who also puts in effort. If the boss holds the profit, they benefit but if they pass and use it for the worker and business, it grows."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,Maybe getting to know some critical information. If you hold it by yourself you will get huge advantage 
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"Daily decisions can be based on this, one example could be when you get out with a friend to eat something, if you pay one day the other person might pay another day so It is a win win"
Female,b,BCG,Hold,This game was an example of how to anticipate reactions from others and how to respond. Life is calculated and our responses have major effect on everyone around us
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I think that the interaction is meant to mirror whether when given money the people would share or not. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"choosing a walking route, gambling thoghts. How decisions are made and risk assessement"
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"Maybe it is trying to capture a cooperation scenario, In my experience, people tend to approach collaboration either as a competition or as a good faith collaboration, but a lot are too selfish to try a true cooperation."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,it is trying to capture greed when it comes to giving? so as to you not expect being rewarded when being nice to others
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"Everyday life is a gamble, have you made the right choices? Have you turned the right way to avoid traffic? Did you treat someone like you should have done? I feel like it is trying to capture an understanding of how risk averse we are. Will most people choose to hold or will most choose to risk and give them away? It is kind of like society as a whole, generally someone with less will give more and someone wilth more is more likely to hoard their gains."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,It is about cooperation towards same goal. By working together and not trying to hold onto all the gains you may acquire more.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,It reminds me of give and take and that lots of things are not equal and lots of people are mostly concerned about themselves.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I cannot think of a specific example that is the same as the game but it is related to taking actions and see how egocentric people is, your action will be repercuting the gains of the other one so you will decide if it's better to share and both have a beneefit or just keep it all for your own, knowing that the other one will get nothing in return. "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,I think it reminds me of daily challenges where you need to choose either the safe or the risky option. For example you could save some of your money in cash someewhere in your home and theoretically (not including inflation) you would have the same amount of money in a year. But you could invest your money somewhere and hope for its' growth.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of a game of probability or betting where you decide whether to hold or bet, but there's a chance that if you bet, you either win more or win nothing."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of the many chances I have to take in mu day to day life. Choosing to trust anothee to have the best interest of all parties in mind can be frightening but, in my opinion, taking these kind of risks can often be very rewarding. I think the researchers are trying to see how many people will choose a sure but worse outcome insted of trusting a stranger in the hope of a better one. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It is trying to capture the way people interact and gain/lose according to other people's actions. Sometimes it is worth ""taking over"" (holding in this case) and minimizing risk. Other times you feel that it is ok to take the risk and rely on someone else, hoping the end result will be better for both of you."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,It reminds me of situations from everyday life and reading what intentions other people may have towards you
Male,a,BCG,Pass,maybe how gambling lotteries works or loans to the banks. the need to risk some to win more
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I can't think of anything that completely captures the same feeling as this. However, I'd say the general concept of sharing is slightly similar to this in some way. If you don't share something, you still keep what you have despite the other person not getting to have it but if you share, you both have something even if it's not ""as much"" as the original piece."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"In esence, this interaction reminds me on how we take decisions to have the best payoff posible when given an scenario in which you are competing with someone else. So we are willing to take the better option for us."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I'm sorry, I have no idea what this is trying to capture. For me it's just a game."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think this activity is trying to show how people manage money. Do they prefer to share the profits from cooperation or take everything for themselves? When both parties decide to cooperate, we gain much more than when we try to take everything for ourselves."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I believe the task is about how you see the problems, either you go for it and take risks or you decide to be more careful and stay where you are. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"That's good not to be selfish, and it's great to be cooperative and do teamwork."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Very complex to fully understand first time,  must have patience and read slowly"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It's about looking out for both individuals, not always wanting everything for oneself. We should be sharing and considerate of others. You never know when that good deed you did might also come back to you."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of any bargaining situation and the risk you may have to take. For example when you want to sell a product that does not have a specific price you may ask for a higher return than the products value. This way you may end up with a bigger profit but you risk the possibility of the buyer backing off.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,this strategy reminds me of digital currency tokens like crypto currencies. The aim is to be patient and not just go ahead and trade in a short space of time. The goal is to reap a greater reward than what was initially put in as i am doing now.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"That doesn't really reminds me to something that had happened in my real life. However, I think it's trying to reinforce empathy. They do it by ""forcing"" you to play the game and telling you all the rules. If you're selfish, you can find you have less money, but if you are not both can have the same!"
Female,a,BCG,Pass,Reminds me of when i buy chocolate and hide it from my siblings and I don't want to share. Too much chocolate is bad for you but I'd rather have the slab by myself cause I bought it.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds of me the kinds of decisions that I have to make as I go about my daily life and think about the things that I have to get done and why I have to do them. My goal is to maximize my time and reduce my frustrations in my own life. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I think it is mostly about trust and trust issues. If we work together we can achieve higher goals. If we are just thinking about ourselves we have a solid but way less benefit. 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I believe in this task the the organisers are trying to capture the thought process in situations where people have to make a decision whilst taking a risk. here, whilst knowing that the decision of an unknown counterpart will affect my payment, I nave to decide what will possibly be the best."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think is better to get something both of us since we are doing the same job, I think it reminds me on trying to help the others as well helping me "
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"For me, this does not remind me to anything that would truly be similar, however, I feel like this is how workplaces work, for example. I, as a basic worker contribute to my workplace with my time and effort, while they can keep all the reward from these, or share them with me. Also, if I do not contribute to my workplace, I will not be rewarded well enough (or, as menitoned, this might not be a good example, as in this case) I would not be rewarded at all"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"whether I am more interested in choosing something that benefits more people than just myself, or whether I am more interested in my own benefit"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I think it tries to capture how individuals depend on each other and can benefit more if they are willing to participate the same way. It reminds me when in school if we pair up we can achieve a lot more out of the assigned task. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"Well, this interaction I have just completed reminds me of simple favors that someone is doing for me and I choose to keep it in my mind and ""re-pay"" them with help once they need it. It is simple but I think it perfectly describes the interaction I just had"
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think it tries to compare to maybe stocks in real life or something similar
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of zero sum games, where we try to manage our expectations as well as other people's expectations. You can never predict what they behaviour might be, but you hope that they will compromise as to benefit not just the self, but the community. It's a situation that you find in a lot of environments, specially with managing people. What is best for one, might be put the other in a less favorable position, so what would people do with that knowledge? It really incaptures the human nature of social dynamics and power games."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"Relationships in my job. Yeah I could win more being a selfish person, but that just simply doesn't go with me. Id feel too much guilty."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,it reminds me about taking changes in life if you dont take the chance to continue you never now what more you could gain 
Male,a,BCG,Pass,It's hard for me to relate this situation to everyday life. It reminds me of tests on children where they check whether they will choose one candy now or two in 5 minutes.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I always try to be a better person each day. If we do something for others every day, the world would be better"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Sometimes it is better to look at situations in a long term. Even if you must decide to, for example, share a decision with someone at work, if you do it alone you might just not lose but not win either for you'll have the glory but also loads of work to do alone. As it is always better to pass on, even it the goods get divided with someone else, but in the long term it compensates you with the amount of help you have to perform any kind of work ,and more rapidly."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"Certainly, it seems like you're drawing a parallel between this decision-making scenario and the concept of giving or receiving change after making a purchase. While certain purchasing choices may initially affect the change you receive, it becomes clearer once the transaction is completed. In both situations, understanding the dynamics and roles involved can lead to more favorable outcomes."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I am not completely sure but if i have to guess its about seeing if you are willing to play more safe or risk trusting someone for the chance at a higher reward. I guess since i do alot of stock trading it reminds me a bit of that but in a smallerr scale
Male,a,BCG,Pass,When I just came accors this type is question / situation. My first thought caught up of the business. If you invest some amount and if you keep adding your all efforts it will increase your over all profit and revenue in the end. So keep pushing and you will get there.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"To be perfectly honest, I fail to make a connection between this situation and an instance in day to day life. My advice was simply regarding the way that I would react in such a situation. I would go for a low risk/low reward approach, seeing that with higher numbers I might lose my cool and let emotions cloud my judgement."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of making a bet with my friends, and it's mostly about analyzing how a player's mind works when deciding how to play the bet. It's important to understand what the opposing player is thinking to increase your chances of winning. It's a game of psychology and strategy."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"For me this is a win win situation, so, if you always stay humble and honest everyone can grow, you shouldnt hurt other people for your own financial interest because in this situation, someone trusted you to pass, if they did you should not trick them. For me, alwats stay humble, never look down or cheat on someone, because one day it can be you. The thoughts that the experiment is trying to get may be different from mine."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This reminds of working on a project with a team where each member is assigned a different role form others. At the end of the day, we all had to chip into one member's role because he was struggling with some tasks and we agreed that in order for all of us to finish, we needed to contribute and help him complete his tasks. This is the essence of team work."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I think it reminds me of lottery game or games of chance. Where you pay an entry fee for a chance to win a lot more than the entry fee, or sometimes just a little more than the entry fee. It's always a risk because you can lose the game and lose your entry fee."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,It really just reminds me wealth sharing. Should I share my wealth with the less fortunate or at least a part of it? But it also reminded me of strategic board games where I try to maximise my points. Regardless the lighthearted nature of these games I often clash with my game parthners.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"we make decisions in our everyday life. so this gave it is like a probability of decision, whether it will happen or not or there is fifty percent chances"
Female,a,BCG,Pass, We are always having to make decisions. Think about the benefits but taking into account others. Be supportive of others so that they are supportive of us too.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This might be equivalent to any negotiation one might face during our lives, from bargain shopping on a street market to a negotiation with a potential customer in our jobs or even negotiating a paygrade on a new job. This might give an indication on the ammount of risk a specific group might be ready to accept, affecting most decisions in life."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"Some times we have to think in beter actions, think in the other person to, and what he can provide to us, and never chose the easy way"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think that this interaction reminds me of a situation where if you work together with other person you can get more than if you are greedy and don't want to help achieve more with the other person or don't have enough trust on them.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This felt a lot like community gain vs personal gain. Whether you as an individual are willing to work and be part of a community (team) or just place your needs above it all. It can feel risky because everyone is faced with the decision but if all decided to work as a team... it would benefit everyone more.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Maybe when I have to decide a win-win situation. When I have to work a lot and someone has not, we talk with each other and we talk about the situation. We take the 50-50 Method. They work 4hours and I work 4hours. They win because they get money, and I win because I do not have to work that much"
Male,b,BCG,Hold,Use your money (tokens) by investing it so your money can grow long term because it loses its value after a few years
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of the classic prisoner dilemma with a twist. In the game, I knew the other player decided to pass, helping me. It was a question of fairness versus selfishness."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,Decision making for personal gain. Or personal loss. It's to see how you think and capture your thought process for decision making
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think all of this task is linked with investment. Maybe something like crypto distribution. I saw crypto projects that were working like that.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I think its trying to capture the mutual help between people, as well as hope in the other, as well as stimulate feelings of share and detect selfishness"
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I would say that it remands me of a lot of things from daily life, for example the concept of delayed gratification. Like deciding to buy a lottery ticket you invest an amount but there is a chance of getting your investment back with some more. Or keeping the original money and having the same amount after. Or this could also represent keeping my money in the bank vs cashing it out which will lower its value and there any be any interest on it "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"i coulnd think about anything, the best idea that comes to my mind is sending/recieving referals codes for some gambling sites"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think it's about sharing with people. If u give something to people, they can give you something else im favor. In that way, both of you want some profits"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"Reminds me of the ""17th tram"" situation: The tram comes every 5 minutes. Many times, I get to tram stop 5 or 4 minutes before the next one is coming. There is a store nearby, where it takes 3 minutes to buy a chocolate bar and a soda, but only if there is nobody else in the store. If someone else is there, I am most likely going to be latef from the tram. Everytime, I have to *take the risk* of having to wait for the second tram, when I decide to get a chocolate bar and a drink.  "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This situation is like those real-life negotiations where making smart moves is essential to get the best results. It's all about strategy and making the right choices to reach the best possible outcome. 
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"This reminds of being helpful to other people. If we are eager to help, people tend to help us in return. Of course it is not always a case, but I believe we should give good example."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"In my case, it reminds me of when one goes to a market where haggling is possible, where the seller tries to maximize their profit while selling the product, and the buyer tries to get the product at the lowest possible cost (maximizing cost-benefit). In this specific case of the survey, I believe it's about observing the behavior of two people who, knowing their roles, must choose what they think will be their best opportunity for benefit. If the situation warrants it, they may aim to maximize their gain or be fair to the other party and split the proceeds equally."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me that although vying for oneself might sometimes produce more ""money"" or a better individual outcome, we should also care about how our actions affect other people and a win-win situation for everyone is always the best outcome, in my opinion.  "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of the interaction of investing and saving. Investing your money is similar to that of passing tokens as by adding more you accumulate more of your investment in the end of the process. And holding is similar to that of saving your money to accumulate interest.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"it is interesting to think that player A is ""trusting"" but maybe is trying only to improve their odds, if player B decides to keep the money might be presented as a villain, but i dont think thats necessary the case. I bealive in the win win situations, but sometimes the fact that you trust someone doesnt mean you are doing it for the good reasons, it is because that also benefits you, so in this particular case i dont think there are a good guy or a bad guy, just decisions to make. Helping others is always better for me, but i wouldt judge my teamate "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,i think it is about considering other people as well as yourself and trying to do something that will benefit both people. It's about being generous but also looking out for yourself as well as others 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Personally, this action reminds me of those moments when you have to decide whether you're going to do something for your own benefit that might potentially affect someone else, or if you're going to choose to work as a team and share the gains."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This games doesn't remind me of any real life situation and again, I need more information about it to be able to have an opinion."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,This game reminded me quite of the businesses like cryptocurrencies and stock portfolios.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of the game monopoly, the book by Robert Kiyosaki rich dad poor dad. It also remind me of people in general and how greedy and financial illiterate they are and how school does not want us to learn management of finances to gain financial freedom."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminded me of any time I have to make an impactful decision in my day to day life, whether it be choosing one company over another for services I need, or which product I buy in the store. Each decision I make has consequences to me and, most of the time , others. Making these decisions requires thought and a selfish viewpoint. It also sometimes requires us to trust in others for the best outcome. Perhaps this study is looking at how people make decisions when obvious risks and rewards are involved? Not sure!  "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of the daily sacrifices l make of thinking of the other person before myself. I feel like this interaction is trying to show us and remind us of how god it is to be selfless and think of others .we should be able to share the little we have with others.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think it is similar to investing. There are similaritys with playing pokker or similar board games. It makes you think about when to cash out or stay in the game. When having a belief to eachother motives to move forward can benefit both parties. 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It's about how a person acts based on their beliefs, and how you can never know with certainty how the other person will act. Human behavior can be unpredictable, and decisions often depend on individual beliefs and perceptions."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think that this interaction is maybe trying to capture how likely we can share things with others. Also how likely we want not to think only about us. If two players decided to pass tokens they both get equally and fairly..  
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think this interaction is trying to teach us that if we are willing to first give something away we are most likely to get something in return of higher value
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I really have no idea, however it could be that it is good to interact with others at times. Then , there are other times that one just need to pause (hold)and take a breather. I think this is where you gain the most. Once done you can return to interacting with others."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,it reminds me of choosing what action would profit best for an individual or is it better to redistribute profits among both individuals
Female,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds me that it is very important to work well with others and to not be selfish. Always think about how the other person will be affected in what you do but also remember to focus on yourself too.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of normal financial investments, stocks, mutual funds, in which each of us gives an amount to a company and gets an interest. the rules of this interaction are complex, for both parties to earn the maximum it is necessary for each party to give money to the other, first lends it, the second returns it."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"Honestly doesn't remind me of any similar situation i could experience in my daily life, i assume this is a psychological study about trust and social behaviours, but i honestly don't know what is trying to capture exactly."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I believe it's about the roles we take on at home, in school, or in the office when working as a team and engaging in collaborative activities that require equal effort from all team members."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"Chess, and when tackling problem solving or trying to build something from scratch with given instructions and a lot of tools and parts to assemble "
Female,b,BCG,Hold,It reminded me of most decisions I make daily. I like to be thorough and plan things out.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,Investing in any economic field is like deciding whether it's a good idea to start a particular business or make a specific purchase. It involves evaluating the potential future benefits that it can bring you. Making informed investment decisions often requires careful analysis and consideration of various factors to assess the potential return on investment.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I think it's quite hard to understand and requires a lot of brain power. You have to think of all the outcomes for if you are assigned A and the decisions you make will change if you are B. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have a clue what it is trying to capture unfortunately sorry. 
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It's similar to when you receive a payment and have to use that money to buy a gift for a friend. In both situations, you need to make decisions about how to use your resources to maximize the benefit or satisfaction for both parties involved."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"The human mind has to comprehend and make many many decisions in a single day. This reminds one to not overthink, go with your gut feeling and choose what will bring about goodness."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I believe this interaction is an exercise in collaboration, which often occurs in negotiations. Ideally, both participants should collaborate to ensure that everyone receives benefits. Cooperation and working together can lead to more favorable outcomes for all parties involved."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think that it is a good way to think in the future of my investments and another things related to money
Male,b,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of a negotiation in wich i don't know what the other part will do or what should be my next step
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Sometimes there are opportunities that could help not only yourself, but also a friend or stranger. It is easy to want all the benefit for yourself, but better to share"
Female,b,BCG,Hold,How we make decisions. Based on situations given we need t decide what is best for us 
Male,a,BCG,Hold,I think this game is when you are sat at home overthinking and trying to guess what others are going to do 
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"Honestly, it doesn't remind me of anything in my daily life. It reminds me of gambling games, but not of my daily life."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds of saving money. I think it is trying to capture the act of saving money in a bank account...
Female,a,BCG,Pass,It reminds me we have to have faith in things and trust everything will workout for us
Female,a,BCG,Hold,It's important that you hold and trying to think a bit about your problems and how you can try to fix them before you can rush to conclusions or doing stupid things that may affect you afterwards.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,It seemed to me that this game is similar to gambling or trading relations between people.  The goal here is to earn more winnings than your partner.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"It doesn't remind me of a daily life situation. I think it is trying to capture human's limit to trust, as you very often give something of yours on stakes of another person and the pay-off depends solely on their decision. This mistrust makes you earn more, as you choose safer option rather than riskier, more profitable one"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Hmm... I'm always thinking to myself, that this is how life looks. From my own experience and from what I've seen around me sometimes when you gain more, other people don't gain anything and sometimes we just all live day by day equally getting somethin, but never ever more than that."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"IN many cases in real life its best to keep what you have instead of risking everything, "
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of teamwork, trusting one's instincts, as well as the importance of paying attention to whatever task you're doing. "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,i didn't do much but it sounds like how investment plans work and how risky they are
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I saw this game primarily as a resemblance of a game of poker. However, it could resemble some other, more daily life situations in which you are required yo to take risks."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,It is like getting into a negotiations with people with completely different plans about spending time on vacation 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of how we should all be more thoughtful of each other and help each other.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I can't recall anything in my daily life that would circle back to this problem, however I do think the point of this problem falls on someones greed. Greed is gonna be the main way both players come out losing "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,Its about how some people tryst that everyone is consoderate of the other person and not selfish
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think that is is trying to capture the willingsness for taking the risk. You have to count on random person to make descision not knowing who he is or what are his motivations. The most moral option is for both players to pass is that way you both get reward
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Trust is essential to gain more, cooperation is always important, in a group project one could steal all the credit for a team effort but then no one will work with them anymore"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I honestly have no idea what this is trying to capture, and in my daily life I don't normally think about loaning anything with the intent to get back more of if. "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I do not know what this interaction is trying to capture. It does not remind me of anything from my daily life. I found the description to be quite confusing. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,it reminds me of hard decisions that i have to mae without knowing what the outcome will be 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think this interaction is making us think about everyday situations in which we have to share something with someone else and that we should mostly share with each other so that everyone gets the same. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"Nothing specific comes to mind. In certain situations I think it's better to work together in order to make more out of it, as long as there's trust. If someone decided to trust me I wouldn't feel good to break that trust, as long as it doesn't have a negative impact on me."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,It's trying to see the selfishness of man. Reminds me of UK game show GoldenBalls.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,I think the idea is to weigh up reward and consequence. We do not know what the other player will do. You have to think what your actions will cause.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I think that this interaction is inspired by the games theory. It also illustrates that people can sometimes be jerks, if they are given the choice (here : earning more as a jerk than as a good person). Cames theory is actually very much present in everyday's life (sadly). "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me that those who don't take risks don't gain anything, while those who risk something are gambling to win more or lose it all, or at least a significant portion."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I feel it is trying to capture the himan nature between sharing or being greedy and keeping things for yourself
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"it reminds me about making decisions in the shop when i'm buying something, because i need to think if i really need to spend my money on it or save the money for later"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,when in college you share a homework with your classmate and help eachother
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Every day, we can make choices that could help others, but sometimes we don't want to help others, so we don't think about what we could win, we just think about the other's benefit, selfish people don't help others even if there is going to be a benefit for both parts, because only they want to win."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,In my mind this interaction feels close to gambling or cryptocurrency investing. Since there is always the risk of loosing all of our money. In this interaction the crucial part is trust we put in strangers when hoping to make money.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,in the my daily life this reminds me of the relationship between my studies and using my cellphone or laptop for other activities 
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"That in the daily life one should always look after your things, because most of the times people will do the same and it is very understandable"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"The interaction reminded me of the our system's wealth distribution in a way. When people choose to not be greedy and share, everyone benefits in the end. Which is certainly not the current status in our society."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of situations where you choose to make a selfish decision or a decision that is helpful for everyone. I think that is what the game is trying to capture, the initial reaction of wanting to think for everyone or just focus on self."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"Cant real have a clear picture of what u might be considering , perhaps the sense of decision and the way people decide when there is someone more involved"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"Reminds me a bit of the prisoner dilemma. From daily life it reminds of group work in school, where they try to teach that if everyone works we are all graded better. The reality is not so linear, laziness can be crossed with the greed aspect of this problem"
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I analyze if the choice I  will make will benefit me or the next person in any way, if it does I go for it and if doesn't then I don't do it."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I was in a negotiation with my employer recently. Given the unequal economic power they sort of had the upper hand, however, as a professional, who knows their system inside out, I had a fair fighting chance. It was and still is a nightmare as they keep pushing their toxic agenda at me while I have to keep pushing back. "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,well its more like when you borrow money depending on how you get it back it may be a surplus or deficit
Male,a,BCG,Hold,i think it is trying to show how you never know the next persons move. You make a move in life and can only hope that the next person makes a move that will benefit the both of you but you never truly know until the end result 
Male,a,BCG,Pass," It's about finding a way for everyone to gain the maximum possible benefit. The optimal distribution is 15 chips for each player. Both players win 50% of what they wager. The second distribution is very unequal and carries the risk of leaving both players with 10 chips each instead of 15 each. This concept can be applied in everyday life in many situations, such as negotiations at work, family agreements, or the distribution of tasks among friends. The idea is to seek solutions that benefit all parties involved in an equitable manner."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"reminds me of simple life choices one has to make in order to survive daily, the choices you make on what you going to do or when you are going to buy or sell something, stuff like that."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of life, financial and economic life. You receive money from your work and you can either spend it all or you can invest it and later on you can reap more profits. You choose how you take the best from time invested (working)"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It teaches a lesson on patience, to not rush into quickly settling for what is available as there is more "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,It reminds me my studies when our teachers told us that it is better to cooparate and it's based on studies and science.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This interaction remainds me of experiences that involve risk taking. I do not participate in hazard but it is a hazard of sorts. It could also be trying to capture greed vs trust in strangers.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"It's hard to make a decision if you don't have the knowledge available, and you have to base it only on what you've seen for a while. There is not even a ULM graphic to check the pattern. The problem is memory and this type of task. It's all about whether we are people going out in front or waiting for the opponent to move."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think it is trying to emulate everyday choices that people are faced with. We can choose to play it safe and keep an amount to ourselves, or we can work together and think about mutual gain."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"Generosity and trust. If you are generous and decide to try and share something, someone may take advantage and leave you worse off. It reminds me of a gameshow called Golden Balls where 2 players choose √¢¬Ä¬úsplit√¢¬Ä¬ù or √¢¬Ä¬ústeal√¢¬Ä¬ù to win the prize fund. If one player chooses split and the other steals they take it all, if one steals they take it all, but if both steal then both get nothing."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I think it reflects the basis of decision making when you have no clue on the future, or on your ""opponent"" thoughts. Sometimes you have to take risks."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"The interaction reminds me that nothing is certain, challange yourself and attempt the impossible in order to improve yourself as a person. The interction reminds me tha we have to be humble and ask for help where needed"
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"in my personal case, this interaction reminds me of the possibilities i have of encountering people using the kitchen in my shared flat. sometimes i decide to avoid a certain hour because i think everybody will be there and then i find out no one was; some other times i go at usual dinner time and find everyone; etc. i am not sure what the researchers' purpose is though,"
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"When at work, there is competition with other companies, and your team decides whether to progress and come up with the best proposal or if a member of your team (or you) decides to do nothing, resulting in losses for the company."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,This reminds me that you should always take risks. Taking risks leads to victory in most cases. You cannot hesitate when making important decisions
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I choose to pass because i think it benefit us both than to hold.i think the interaction is trying to see how people think when it comes to sharing benefits with others.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"It sounds like when you make cryptocurrency investments, you don't know how much you'll ultimately gain because the value can both rise and fall, and it's not up to you but rather dependent on market dynamics. It's like having blind trust in what might happen."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"Helping others in your university career has generally brought you many benefits because you've received assistance in areas that you find more challenging. This highlights the importance of collaboration and mutual support, as it can lead to a more well-rounded and successful academic experience."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I think it has something to do with money? I actually don't really know. Or like something about a society research
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It is trying to capture the move in which I make everyday. Look at the hard ones and the easy ones as well. And whether I am able to make decisions based on current or future benefits.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to capture decision making for different alternatives that have varying degrees of losses or gains. It looks at how people balance those alternatives and the risk they choose or forfeit by making their decision.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I would say that what this study is trying to capture is that you will always get better results working on teams. That way everybody will win, else if everybody plays solo, the results will be maybe good a couple of times, but after a while you could stop receiving other people help.  "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,Society greed. Their willingness to lose everything rather than have someone else share. Very true in this world today.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of people who take advantage of others. If they offer their help, it is possible that those people may be taken advantage of despite being good. That is a risk some people are not willing to take."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"The ability to share and to trust another human being vs. incapacity of doing so, and only trust ourselves. I think it can also describe gambling; although this involves humans and the capacity of trusting one another."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"In life in general, you have to keep going and be patient with yourself in order to achieve more of what you want. But if you hold back, life becomes stagnant and rewards are less. Do not follow what other people are doing although some of their decisions can affect you somehow."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,It reminds me to think of not only the now but the future too and also to be logical in thinking and making decisions 
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of how we choose to use our free will. If we knew that our decision could benefit someone else than it would us, would we still choose that option? "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of teamwork at my job and the possibility that someone do nothing and get the reward anyways. 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I believe this is demonstrating the benefits of sharing or holding onto knowledge with others. Usually it is better to work with more people than by yourself. It is also possible that the second person can be greedy and take more ownership of what they were given.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,this scenario want to access greed in people and evaluate how the work under pressure 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think sometimes in life you have to take risks because that how you can grow especially when it comes to business and finance. for example if you have $10 , if you keep it like that for a year it remains the same but if you invest it the it will grow."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,This kind of interaction reminds me of my daily life. I think this was to see how well we can play the game but also what kind of advice i would give someone who is also playing the game.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,reminds me when i play poker because the goal is to collect the more coins you can but if you need you must pass
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of collaborations with freelance clients, where you are coming together via contact to mutually benefit one another and requires some degree of trust "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of the importance of making thoughtful decisions in everyday life. Just like in a game, our daily actions can have long-term consequences, and sometimes, taking a step back and waiting for the right moment can lead to more favorable outcomes. Patience and strategy are valuable in the game of life."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of hazard, because it involves risk. Risk can be involved in any part of life I think both personal and business one."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,My best guess is that in everyday life we give away the little that has been given to us. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I guess it's all about how much people risk when it comes to money. Some people are quite conservative with their choices as they try to select the safest option. This game also involves how much we trust each other.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I believe the experiment is about commitment and trust in people we don't know. The rules are explained clearly, and if both players commit to making the recommended moves, at the beginning, one of them will lose some chips, but in the end, both will win more chips than if they had made choices that only benefit themselves. By trusting that the other player will follow the instructions and think about the common good of both, you are ensuring that both will win fairly."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,It reminds me that I do have control to make choices in my daily life but the universe ultimately (or higher power). decides 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think it refrences to the desition making of every day because our actions always affects the people that sorrounds us. It about making awarness that being fair to each other doesn't mean you have to loose something we want.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of when there are samples at a store. Some people take just one, but others take many and spoil it for others. I think this study is probably looking at how a more generous act influences others"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"The situation reminds me a bit of the division of labor that occurs in everyday chores. The choices I make will influence the work of my colleagues. We can gain equally, but less. We can only gain more if we cooperate and share our responsibilities fairly."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,I'm not sure but I feel like maybe in doing favors for people. Sometimes the returns will be good but other times it would have been better to not act at all. The results can vary.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,I think this interaction describes a lot of work environment in some way. The way that some people tend to surpass others by having the chance to gain more in the cost of others getting nothing or less. I think that sometimes the bosses of big companies like shein for example aren't acting right when they refuse paying workers a good salary when the companie makes a lot of money when they could make an effort to pay more giving up some of their luxurious life styles and thinking more of others
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me every-day situations of my life, when I chooses what to do with my money. When I leave my money under my pillow, I have this money by my side, but I don√Ç¬¥t have any gain. Otherwise, when I invest my money, I don√Ç¬¥t have this money currently, but finally I will get more money."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,The interaction reminds me of helping others and I think it's trying to capture what's the problem with society and not giving other people what they deserve.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"From my daily life this reminds me of people being selfish. Trying to cut in line, stealing, cheating, lying, etc. Essentially and trying to get the upper hand and their actions causing negative or poor outcomes for someone else. "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"In our life we always have the fear of risk it all, and sometimes when we don't do it we start to feel guily by at least not trying something, and in this ""game"" i imagined the same, since i take risks in my life trying to do more thing to get a better life I also bet all here. "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I believe it is trying to encompass trust and faith. If you are selfish, you will retain a small amount. If you have trust and go the risky route, there may be higher payout."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"No risk, no reward. It is best to play the game of life than not to play at all, as the rewards seem to grow exponentially as yoi go on"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"prisoners dilema, or that british tv show (golden balls?) about making one of two choices. "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of planning out my day and trying to organize my schedule. 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,It is possible to gain more by passing but it all depends on another person wishing the same outcome.  You have to take risks to get ahead sometimes.  I can't think of something in particular that it reminds me of. 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I'm not too sure. It makes me think about we all have similar goals and can help each other reach them, whether we know each other or are strangers. But there are also options we can choose that may screw over other people but get us further ahead faster."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,It goes with e everyday decisions making and  chose we have to make through out our day 
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of gambling and trusting others, a bit. It comes down to how much risk I want to take. It also involved thinking though other people's motivations and what they would likely do"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I think it's trying to capture our trust in strangers in a monetary situation. It reminds me of expecting kindness back from a person you just showed kindness to. It reminds me of collaboration and spreading wealth to others.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I believe this interaction is similar to a card game in which you are able to determine your play based off of what your cards are and what the players are doing.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"To be honest, nothing is coming to mind. This interaction reminds me of absolutely nothing. Making a minimum of 3 sentences is wild."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It's trying to capture how generous we are willing to be with others.  How much we trust other people to give back to us when we are generous with them.  It is like how much you are willing to help a friend move houses and would you help them, when they need to move."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This decision problem almost definitely reminds me of the prisoner's dilemma. This is a problem very commonly used to teach game theory and shows a lot about human psychology. The format of this decision problem is very close and thus evocative of the dilemma. 
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I'm not really sure.  Maybe it can relate to gambling or investments.  I can't really think of a time when I have to interact with someone on this level for gain.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,This interaction doesn't remind me of a specific situation in my daily life.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Because there is no strategy, its pure risk versus reward. Either way you are dependent on your assigned partner and it comes down to are you being selfish by opting to take 5 from the get go and being a party pooper, or do you leave it in their hands and hope they aren't going to be greedy. Such is life."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I think the study is focusing on the aspects of greed in relation to people whom you don't personally know.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This is baffling to me. I think it was to reflect on giving to another person, instead of keeping the money for myself. It may be about selflessness "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of the fact that there are always scenarios where people who are trying to be helpful get screwed over. It happens every second of every day. Politicians and corporations are the biggest offenders.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I'm really not sure what interaction this made me think of because I didn't think about anything other than the rules
Male,a,BCG,Hold,Trying  to see if you are willing to see how you will react to keepinv the tokens ir will you be kind enough  topass some of your tokens  
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I can't think of anything this interaction resembles in daily life. It might be trying to capture how much people are willing to trust strangers. Perhaps the interaction is meant to measure how much people go by logic vs emotion in these scenarios?
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"In life there are often situations where making short sighted, selfish decision may end in immediate payoff but not be very fruitful longterm. Often, society forces us into these situations even if we do not want to be selfish. For example, in a modern day wage labor system, we may have to look out for ourselves out of necessity since we often cannot physically afford to worry about or share with others."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,Determining the feelings of others. You deciding what is the best course of action to do the most good
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of gambling or any situation where you have to weigh your options. If you make a move too soon, you may end up in a worse situation. If you take too long, you could end up in a worse situation. It makes me think about timing of decisions the odds that it will turn out in your favor."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,Maybe as im a student it is really similar as for example when you write a test but you only knew certain parts of it so as to say your friend is getting the test that you know and you get the test that your friends knows. but on  the other hand is similar to like gambling 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of bank investment. Honestly the options for player B are just ""doing their job"" or embezzlement, as long as we are comparing it to a real life scenario. Reminds me of games life the prisoner's dilemma and such."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of the prisoner's dilemma. It is trying to measure cooperation. However, the stakes are much lower in this game."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It kind of reminds me of a lunchroom. If one person passes on their helping of food, there could be more available for another person. This is kind of like roles an and b. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"Many decision involve choosing between what is best personally, and what is best for everyone. This can apply to something as simple as taking the last parking space, or something as complex as choosing environmentally sustainable products. Making a decision that is costlier personally, that has a net benefit to everyone can be difficult, bordering on impossible, but has larger implications to the psychology of decision making."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"This exercise is trying to capture that if both sides agree and do the right things, both sides can be rewarded equally more than initially."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"In a way, this scenario reminds me of giving money to others.  One person could give a little money to another; therefore, getting less money himself.  The person receiving the money has the option to keep more for himself or spread it out more equally."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This interaction somewhat reminds me of the lottery or of gambling. I think it is trying to capture how or why people decide how to play. People who pass may be more trusting versus people who hold are less trusting. 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think this interaction reminds me to work with others and not be too cautious or too selfish. Being kind and loaning money can only help you in the end. I think this reminds me to be kind and to take a risk or I won√¢¬Ä¬ôt get anywhere in life. 
Male,a,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of when countries need to get along but they don't want to be stabbed in the back. It's like when I have a project at work. We all know we need to work on it but no one wants to be stuck with the majority of it.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of the importance in working together. When we work together, both parties can benefit. We can benefit doing things ourselves, but the reward is greater when we work together."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,trusting in others that they are playing to make each other better in life and not hoarding it just for themselves
Male,a,BCG,Pass,Its trying to describe the situattion of risk and gain. Pretty much as player a you are the average joe who can lose everything if the higher entity of wealth decide to screw you over. Meanwhile player B as the wealth entity can do what every he wants and still profit to a degree.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,It reminds me of people choosing to be selfish or choosing to care about other people as well. A lot of times people seem to choose the best for themselves and don't really care about the other person. They goodness there are other people that do care about other people besides themselves.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of human nature and how if everyone supports eachother, you are all likely to be more successful. This isn't perfect however, due to greed and the desire for more. Knowing this, I'd play the game safe and manipulate greed in to my own benefit just like in real life."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"The majority of us do not live alone in the sense that we have daily interactions. Each day, we make numerous decisions to trust others hoping the outcome will be positive and the good deeds gets passed on. Sometimes we might be snubbed or sometimes what good goes around and comes back around. We just decide to give and knowing that whatever happens, we don't lose anything in our giving. "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,Im really not sure how to answer this question correctly but I would say that maybe its based on how your make decisions in life and what the outcomes can be if planned correctly for yourself or both parties involved.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,It kind of just reminds me of everyday life. We have to pay it forward and help each other and be trusting. If no then no one will make it. Thats why I was trusting and passed. 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Sometimes when you work together with others you are able to maximize and redistribute outcomes equally. Often we are in situations where we choose to keep or hoard more for ourselves, like during the pandemic when stores ran out of toilet paper because people were scared. However this situation allows for an outcome where you can both maximize the outcome and share it evenly so long as both parties choose to do so. I don't think that's very common."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"Honestly, I am not sure. I can't think of anything right now in my daily life where I hold onto money and am guaranteed that money for holding it but then might get 0 or 3 times the amount back for ""loaning"" it. The stock market is all I can think about, but this is not exactly how it works at all. "
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I think that this interaction attempts to assess the idea of generosity between strangers.  I also think it is meant to assess selfishness.  Since the players do not each others identity, aai think the game is a good indicator of different personalities and values."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,It can seem like daily life is a series of small decisions about taking risks. Do I run into the store without putting money in the meter? One is always measuring potential payoff versus a sure thing.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think the interactions are trying to capture trust between parties and decision making
Female,a,BCG,Pass,This interaction could be in reference to trickle down economy. Or about how if you both work together you will reap similar benefits vs. working for yourself. Working together is always the best and most equal option.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"In daily life, it is about working together to make share the wealth I think.  But we will see how this plays out. Unfortunately in daily life, there are those who usually take all for themselves and don't worry about the needs of others."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I think this interaction reminds me the principle of greed. Sometimes it pays to hold and wait. Other times it pays to not hold and get your result. But usually if you hold, you will have your earnings and not have to split."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think it is capturing the idea of reciprocity and relying on others to achieve an outcome that maximizes the collective good. It asks the question of whether we can trust strangers to sacrifice some of their own well-being to generate even more well-being for someone else who helped them.  
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think it's trying to capture the decision of whether to depend on another for mutual benefit. I think on a bigger monetary scale, the game would be very hard. If it was $500, with a potential $2000 payoff for the second anonymous player, I don't see the Player A getting $1500 ever,  Maybe it√¢¬Ä¬ôs trying to simulate what it like for an investor for a high risk crypto/business venture? I see stories of people scamming investors, taking all the investment money and not actually doing what the claim to? Maybe I'm overthinking it."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,Finding a mutually beneficial situation to cooperate. I can't think of an interaction in my daily life that operates like this. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of situations in daily life where we must decide whether to trust someone and lend them money or any other resource. It also reflects the importance of reciprocity in relationships, since if both roles decide to lend, both benefit and end up with more resources. Overall, I think this interaction captures economic decision-making based on trust and reciprocity in our everyday relationships."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I think it's trying to capture how trusting people are or are not of strangers. I have found that strangers, especially when they are anonymous, simply look out for themselves. I feel a little guilty doing that, but I also feel like it might be the wiser financial decision, so that is what I do."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of working together to achieve a better result. If you hold in the scenario, you receive less tokens and if you keep things to yourself in real life, then other people may not benefit from what you have to share and you may not benefit from them as well."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"This reminds me of reinvesting into something like stocks. If you hold, there is that, but if you buy another, there is a chance it will increase."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think you're testing how much people feel trusting toward giving to the community. People can hold on to the resources they have and benefit themselves for sure, or they can give to a community pool and potentially benefit others and themselves more. There's a chance that someone will be greedy, but that chance is going to be there regardless."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I could equate it to betting. In games found at casinos such as poker you often increase your initial starting amount if you play well but in the end you usually end up losing it all. I think this shows the balance between risk and pulling out while your ahead.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,It can capture trust between two companies that are trying to make the most money or keep their relationships
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This doesn't really remind me of anything regarding my daily life. Maybe like a game of spades, where you're playing with a partner but really can't communicate? This is just a game of chance."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of gambling or a coin toss with money involved. There probability and outcomes are limited and there is a fifty-fifty chance of passing or holding. It also reminds me of making a yes or no decision, because there are just two options."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not too sure but maybe It is trying to mimick saving money. It also reminds me of any situation where you can make a small sacrifice in order to let everybody gain a little bit. It also reminds me of economic gaps in todays society
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of a time where I was working at my job and had to give a new employee advice. I felt a little unsure, but did my best. I think my knowledge was at least somewhat helpful. "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think this interaction is trying to capture the essence of human greed or ability to work together to maximize outcomes. If people are greedy or mistrustful they will not pass and will not maximize their reward. If everyone works together the total rewards are higher for everyone involved. So its trying to capture that essence, as to whether or not people are out for themselves."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,It reminds me of a task that requires two teams to work together to complete a given task
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I am thinking maybe the research is trying to understand the role of selfishness and altruism when faced with earning potential. 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think this interaction is a representation of the term ""give and you shall receive"". If you choose to pass you get 10 tokens. However, if you choose to pass then you both end up with more in the end. "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I'm not certain what I'd correlate this exercise to in my daily life. Perhaps an exercise in greed versus sharing. A look at who wants the greater good for others versus who would prefer to keep an excess for themselves. What type of person would rather play it safe or roll the dice on an reliance of a stranger for a stronger outcome? 
Female,a,BCG,Hold,This particular decision doesn't really apply to my everyday life. I'm not in a scenario like this so it is not relatable. There might be something deeper that I'm not aware of. 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I believe the decision goes into people's selfishness when making choices involving someone else. It is very easy to pick an option that could affect you positively and hurt someone else. This decision problem illustrates that very idea and the choices people make.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I'm not sure if it reminds me of anything from daily life.  But it does require putting trust in others to do what is best for the group.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I could draw this from everyday life to, say, the morning public transport, when you have to travel with a lot of other people and have to decide whether or not to sit or give up your seat to someone else. Also, when you have to adapt to other people at work."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I thought it was interesting to play. I think it's a lot like life in many aspects. One of the ways is being able to communicate in a stronger way that leads to a great and beneficial decision. I like how the game is played and enjoyed learning about it.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I think it is about how much trust people will place in strangers to be generous rather than keeping resources for themselves. If participant A chooses to pass then they risk getting no bonus. However, if both workers pass then the sum of the profit for the 2 individuals is higher. I think this survey wants to show if people will take that risk in the hopes of gaining more. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of investing in stocks, and the risks and unpredictability of the economy"
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of the myth of trickle-down economics. That the wealth passes along from the top to the bottom however this rarely occurs as people at the top have incentives to maximize profits and squeeze out the lower class of every penny they can
Male,b,BCG,Pass,It seems like it is trying capture the choices that people will make when money is involved. Given the capitalist hellscape we live in that means someone might try to take most or all for themselves when it is just as easy to split the outcome
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I think that it is trying to determin how selfish people are with money. The ideal situation would be for both to pass and end with an equal amount. If either decided to hold it ends up becoming a deficite to one or the other. It seem to be an example of the greater good concept.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Seeking advice from a more experienced friend on how to approach a particular activity, with an emphasis on strategy and calm."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"The interaction immediately reminds me of the trust that I put in people every day. Similar to this scenario, if you pass and leave the decision in the hands of Player B, you have to have substantial trust in that person, or a lack of concern about losing out on everything, in order to pass it on. Similarly, in real life, for example, I have to have trust in people to lock my bike up and trust that it will not get stolen, and similar situations that are somewhat similar in terms of trust to this."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of a group project I did where each person had a task to do so not one person would be overloaded with tasks. It was a fair allocation of time to each participant and it required trust the other coparticipant would do their part so the project would be finished on time with good results. Everything turned out fine in the project and I learned to be more trusting of people instead of doubting them and that I would be rewarded. This interaction is trying to show that if we work together and strive for an equitable result, everyone will be rewarded. "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"this decision problem describes a basic interaction in the form of somewhat of a game. in the interaction, you decide without knowing your partners choice, whether to keep your points or whether to pass, in which you give 2 points to the other player. but you need to decide the same move to get your points so It pays to pass "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of interactions where you put effort into helping someone else and hoping there's some form of return. Like perhaps I help my coworker and spends hours with some task. I would like to think that they can help me in the future when I need it as well. If they don't reciprocate, I simply spent a lot of effort and got my just desserts for believing they might help me. There's definitely a transactional type of trust component to the activity I just did, and real-life interactions."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"Gambling is pretty risky, I would not put down an amount that I could not afford to lose. Always have some money put to the side in case of emergencies. Small risks are okay if you can afford to lose them."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I don't typically gamble so it doesn't capture much of my life, and when I do i usually regret it so It's not favorable to me.  I simply think this problem is trying to capture the average person's risk management process. It's attempting to recreate one of the more popular forms of gambling to do so (the ball drop game)."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,That the average person is always on the lookout for themselves and can't collectively work towards everyone's betterment. People are too focused on making sure that they get ahead. 
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"it reminds me of trust issues I have with people on aa daily basis. especially situtaions where I have to loan people money and decide whether or not I can live without it if they faail to pay me back. In most cases those who borrow, cannot really pay back the money and it is a personal decision whether or not to help them. This also reminds me of investment situtations where one is banking on earning interest on investments than may or may not pan out. "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"If I am to be completely honest when answering this question, I really do not know what it is trying to capture. The interaction from daily life only comes in the form of that I have to make a decision, which is something you do on a daily anyways."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"The interaction reminds me about how I choose to invest my time and energy into certain aspects of my life such as career, health, hobbies, and relationships with others. The decisions that I make usually come down to either invest or not invest into carrying out a decision/action. As a result I would see myself holding specific strengths and weaknesses on various aspects of my life and person. This is similar to how someone can choose to either pass or hold tokens. What I think the interaction tries to capture is how someone is willing to invest (or trust) a valuable commodity for a greater return. This not only applies to monetary investment, but also our time, energy, and confidence into an aspect such as a hobby, a career, their person, or a relationship with someone."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of playing chess. It also reminds me of grocery shopping on a limited budget, i.e., do I pay for the larger block of cheese that costs less per ounce, or do I choose to buy the smaller block of cheese which costs more per ounce, and allows more money to be left within my budget for the month. I'm honestly unsure what this study is trying to capture. Perhaps risk taking preferences among strangers. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,It's trying to capture the ability to trust strangers and whether or not there is still faith left in humanity or if we're all just selfish morons who think for ourselves and keep profits to ourselves.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of stock market trading. You can either hold, keeping some money for yourself, or you can invest it. There is a chance that investing will yield nothing at all, but there is also a chance your money will be returned higher. You can also lose this money if ""B"" decides not to return (market crash or something)."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think that this task reminds one that you can make your own decisions in life but much of the result depends on what others also decide. This is an important thing to remember. Just because you have a clear goal, there are other factors that will dictate whether or not it will be accomplished."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,there is nothing that this reminds me of in real life. it would be similiar to situations where you are trying to guage your risk aversion
Male,a,BCG,Pass,It was interesting so to speak. Nothing to hard. Pretty easy to understand.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,I guess it's trying to capture how much risk I am willing to take. If I loan the token then I am showing that I am willing to risk quite a bit since there is a possibility that I will earn 15 token. But there is also a very real possibility that I end up with nothing
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to capture what kind of advice I would give people. Is the advice to better oneself or do what is better for both parties. 
Female,a,BCG,Hold,i guess how people decide what they can and cannot do with money and how they handle it
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This interactions reminds me of gambling in casinos. I don't gamble myself, but I always hear about ""high risk, high reward."" In this scenario, you are risking all your tokens only to lose them all or gain 3 times what you started with."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It's a trust interaction. It is a gamble based on trust of a stranger. It is like driving in traffic.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Any situation that requires cooperation. In this scenario, if both parties choose what is best for both, they both end up winners. I thought of driving - if is top at a crosswalk to let a pedestrian cross, then we both get where we are going quickly. If either party ignores the other and focuses just on what is best for them. It could end very badly. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,The interaction reminds me of making compromises with people. In daily life making simple decisions like asking to split the bill or pitching in on something with a group of people instead of asking one person to pay for the whole thing. I think it's trying to capture a situation where you can be selfish or be thinking for the group instead.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think that we make this choice every day in the way that we interact with others you have to decide all the time if connecting with strangers is worth the possibility that they will hurt you. And possibly the tendency to gamble.  
Male,b,BCG,Pass,This reminds me of work and consumer transactions. It has a process similar to buying and selling for profit. It feels like it could be used to determine work hours and activity output. It takes measure of risk assessment and reward balance.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It's kind of like choosing to spend your money at a local coffee shop. If you have $10 and choose to hold the money, i.e. keep it for yourself, the game ends. However, if you choose to spend your money on a coffee, then you get to enjoy a fun beverage and the coffee shop makes some money. If the coffee shop were to just take your money and hold it, not giving you a coffee, then it's like P1 passed and P2 held."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"Aside from game theory, this problem reminds me of various political issues. Typically, Senators Representatives have very little impetus to ensure the greatest return for all Americans, but rather maximize returns for their constituency. This increases theirs odds for reelection. "
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction likely measures how trusting a person is of a stranger. As who are more trusting may gamble passing in hopes of both receiving 15. Conversely, an A who is less trusting may choose to hold to avoid ending up with 8"
Female,b,BCG,Hold,This interaction didn't make me think of anything in my daily life. It made me think I'm playing a bad game at an awful party where the rules make no sense to anyone. I wouldn't suggest this to anybody.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of how we should really all work together in society if we want things to go better. It reminds me that of teamwork and cooperation! It also reminds me of the sad truth that other people in society will often look for opportunities to take advantage of others.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me a lot of just how difficult it can be to know the motivations of strangers, acquaintances, and coworkers in our winner takes all society. I'm definitely the kind of person who is much more comfortable with sharing unanticipated bonuses than with hoarding them for myself. However from personal experience even people who seem like non-sociopaths are sometimes very willing to behave selfishly and feel like they made a legitimate moral decision. Capitalism and libertarian ideals are hot garbage in my opinion."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to test selfishness and maybe people's ability to trust an unknown person. 
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I think the interaction is asking how much faith you put in another person and how selfish one can think. This can be applied to lots of things in day to day life. 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think in a way it reminds me of doing good things for people. If someone does something good for me I am likely to do something nice in return. Hopefully it continues in a nice and fair pattern 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of all the decisions that I make in daily life and the consequences that come from those decisions. I would usually think about what would happen if i do ""x"" or if I do ""y"" instead, and what consequences that follow. That is what I think this is trying to capture, at least, in my opinion."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It might be looking into how selfish people are in life. It might be looking into how trusting people are. People's willingness to invest when they have to place their trust into someone else.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It seems like you are trying to see how someone would react if given a choice that will either benefit them or not and what they will choose when another person is also being affected. I have many interactions in my daily life that is is similar to, one of them is donating at the registers when shopping. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of compromise, any time you compromise someone you can run the chance of a win win situation."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"If sharing resources like money, time, effort, food/goods ends up having the benefit of helping everyone versus those that hoard those items instead. "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds of of the risk that comes with managing money. This comes with loaning and investing money. Holding on less risky situations is the way to go. 
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I was assigned B and was told the A passed. Helping me obtain more than double what I already had.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of social experiments that I've heard about before, which are usually set up with prisoner interrogations. Two prisoners are being interrogated, and if prisoner A gives evidence that prisoner B committed the crime then A will go free and B will receive the full sentence, and vice versa for prisoner B. If neither confesses then they will each receive half of the full sentence, but if both testify against each other then they both receive the full sentence. This interaction was similar, but it involved a positive gain, and the participants know the decisions of the counterpart. "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"In general I find it is always best to think through a situation and find a solution that benefits everyone involved. I feel better about myself by trying to make things fair, and there are often intangible benefits to seeking out the most fair solution. It also helps to avoid any sort of resentment or ill will from others."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"The decision reminded me of sharing food with friends. In such moments, we had to choose between generosity or selfishness. Fortunately, we always chose to be generous which strengthened our relationship."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I think this is trying to judge 2 things. The first is if people think about others and what they might benefit over their own selfishness when making a decision. The second is if people are concerned about what they partner picked or what others might think of their choice
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds me that all people act rationally and want to increase or maximize their individual (or family) outcomes.
Male,a,BCG,Hold," The decision issue appears to be similar to comparing different choices with varying outcomes, illustrating the intricacies of everyday decision-making involving careful consideration of multiple factors. This situation probably seeks to highlight the importance of thoughtful assessment in decision-making."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to see if me as the B part am selfish to keep all the money or share with the person A.
Female,b,BCG,Hold," not  sure what it is trying to capture, reminds me of goldenballs on TV"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"this reflects what the decisions the persons make on the daily basis, if they are selfish or if they think about the other persons around them"
Female,a,BCG,Hold,It reminded me of gambling - whether to actually make a bet or pass and not engage in gambling.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"Ive seen this happen sometimes with some games where some people have the choice to either get 100 or split 50 with another person, depending on the choice of both. The problem is that now with no communication, which was present in my example, you just have to assume people are decent. "
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This decision problem seems reminiscent of the classic moral dilemma of choosing between immediate gratification and long-term benefits. It encapsulates the struggle individuals often face when weighing short-term gains against potential long-term consequences. It reflects the complexity inherent in decision-making processes, where one must carefully consider various factors and potential outcomes before arriving at a choice."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think this interaction is trying to capture whether I should betray the trust of a person to obtain a larger gain at the cost of another person. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,In the past i play a game similar like this. Someone told me that this type of activitie is trying to explain how the humanity can grow up .
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"Depending on what the other person chooses is not always good, and we don't always agree"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Honestly, it doesn't remind me of a real life interactions, but more on the things I see on social media, especially TikTok, were people are often put to similar test. They can either get a reward (they are often not informed of what it is) or pass it to another person. This situation is nonetheless created mostly for viewership and therefore I wouldn't call it a real life situation."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This reminds me of many group dynamics I have been in where I put the needs of the group above my own, when it was not necessarily ideal for myself. I think it is trying to measure the self centered-ness of human beings "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think it's about cooperation. Or maybe about taking a risk. Some people are willing to take a risk if it means a future reward, some prefer to play it safe. Maybe it has to do with our personalities."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I think maybe some type of gambling on forex. It reminds me all the decision making that I am doing during the day.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It appears to be linked to business practices: seller A sells something to me B, and if I continue the cycle and sell it forward, the final profit will be higher. Instead, if I choose to hold the material, and don't engage in further business, there's no profit. "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Trusting people - basically how we do things or rather move from a place of either safety or fear. When scared, you're more likely to choose to hold. Hold on to protect yourself, not do much for other people out of the fear of being taken for granted and/or taken advantage of. And we find it easy to pass in communities where we feel safe and know what I pass on, will 1. be replaced vy someone behind me who chooses to pass, and what I've given, will take care and be useful to someone ahead of me."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It reminded me of a game I used to play with friends when I was little, but I forgot the name. Also its about not being a jerk"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Perhaps this exercise is related to the theme of sharing/selfishness. We live in a world where selfishness prevails, so it's always interesting whether people keep everything (the tokens) or share in order to achieve more together. In my opinion, if we share we can both achieve something, so it's always preferable to share. "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,Sometimes its beneficial for everyone to do the right honest moral thing and not act only having in mind one self
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of teamwork. Everyone in the group receives remuneration depending on their involvement. However, it may not always be profitable."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This scenario felt like a team-building or workplace situation. We both can win if we work towards the mutual end goal.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I previously did a similar survey where it was about deciding how much money I was going to save and how much I was going to put into a savings box for several participants, which if we all put more money, we would get more bonus and if we put less then we would only keep what we already had and even so we were given a certain part of the money that belonged to everyone. its like sharing fo rmutual gain"
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This interaction is trying to gauge how selfish people are when it comes to the distribution of funds. Without knowing what the other person it emphasises the need to trust what the other person might do. It is difficult to align this scenario to something that might be experienced in daily life.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It shows how trusting in other people can make u earn more if you work together. It also tests if other person want to invest they money they receive or keep it for themself. Also first player takes the most risk so it requies bravery and trust into next person.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I think it represents the choices we have in our daily life, and the possible promblems that come with those decisions"
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I think its trying to capture whether people decide to be selfish or selfless. Whether they will choose equality over higher values for themselves. It reminds me of sharing benefits equally between myself and my siblings, such as candies, or small amounts of money. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This doesn't really remind me of any given choice I'd make in daily life, but it does seem to attempt to capture just about any resource conflict between two individuals, where the choice that most benefits both parties is ""locked"" behind the egoism of one of them."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"whether we would risk to gain more by trusting others, or take  minimum vicory with surety. "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think it reminds me of team work and how if two parties or more are willing to be kind then everyone will benefit more. If one does not contribute it's as if there is weak link in a chain, so to speak. This can cause the parties to suffer or yeild worse results."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think you want to highlight the part about the possibility of having a greater advantage for yourself versus the security of having a certain amount of money even if it is less. This would aim to better understand the psychology behind these types of choices and the percentage of people who would choose one thing over another.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"it reminds me of the importance of saving investing money wisely, it is something crucial because even if we do not know when it should be used, there will always be an opportunity to invest it or save it strategically"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"It's about trusting someone without knowing anything about them, it's like shopping online or using online banking, where you don't know the other person."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I reminds me of sharing. It is trying to capture how we decide in lotto decisions. It is just a guessing and luck game.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of how every decision made on a daily basis has many contributing factors. Decisions are not typically just made without further thought about how it will affect you as well as others. In this scenario the play was for the most part dependant on what player B decided to do, as player A did not have much control over the situation after they had made their decision. Again showing that not only your own decisions, but also those of other people have a great potential to have either a positive or negative affect on you. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,Maybe a banking situation or investment where if you just keep cash it stays the same but if you invest the money it will grow. 
Female,b,BCG,Hold,It might be trying to figure out if peoples thinking works in  the same way or if people are all like minded or trying to prove a difference in opinion
Female,b,BCG,Pass,that in daily life you also have to make decisions and make a decision or leave things as they are.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"a case in which one person trusts the other and seeks empathy from this person, its a ""common"" theory game, wich the optimal for B is the ""selfish"" option,  then, we seek to recognize whether person b chooses to receive the greater benefit or ""rewards"" the first person for having ""treated well"""
Male,b,BCG,Pass,it is trying to captur how people deal with risk and if they choose to take the safest route and a garanteed payout or take the risk and trust the other contestant so that both get a bigger payout in the end
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminded me of when my partner and I decide where to eat, we either hold (compromise) o pass (choose a different place than the ones we both mentioned)"
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"it reminds me of people in a conversation trying to say only as much as they can without disliked; if they both just talked and gave it all out instead of trying to match the other person, both people would benefit from the conversation"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I believe it the test tries to see greed and how collaborative we are. If we can agree on working in a certain way that benefits both parties despite losing a bit in favour of others. Or if we'd rather have it all and not care about others.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I think what is trying to capture is the greediness that exist in people and how selfish can the people be. I also think that this game can characterize how a people can be described, if is a bold person or more a safe person. In other words, I think that this interaction remind me how pesky can people be."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I don't believe my opponent would give me points so I might as well keep them for myself! Establishing the dynamics of exchange between the parties and determining the roles. Risk is part of life along with uncertainty, which gives us the opportunity to learn daily"
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of certain situations at my job where we can choose to work alone or as a team. If we choose to work alone, we have to accept the risk of the project not being the best it could possibly be, while if we choose to work as a team, we can help eachother achieve a better outcome on the project. I think this interaction is trying to capture how humble or selfish we can be when working as a team knowing that if we all consent to working as a team, the outcome is the best possible."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I believe it is trying to figure out the way people think about investing their own money. In this case, we had to decide if we wanted to keep the tokens or not. It kind of reflects how people decide about investing their money, as it does not only depend on them (in this case, player B would be the bank/the entity in which the person invested the money). Our investments are dependent on us and other factors."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"In life, we have to take risks to gain something but at the same time if we pass, we do not have the chance of losing, so it is becoming a thougth decision to make at the end but at the same it is an investement so we have to chosse the right choice that belongs in our hearts."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I think its trying to capture how decisions are made, particularly where personal gains are involved. It demonstrates trust in others to do what is best for the collective but in reality the best option for yourself is the selfish option. It reminds me of daily work life, where we work as teams but sometimes options should be considered for personal gain."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of the probability and gambling for the greater good. it pushes teamworker and determines if one can make a good choice depending on the previous one
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of a common interaction between people who are investing time in a mutual activity. It models how we interact on subjects and how our perception of the other halves thinking influences our decision.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of a lot of other decision problems, which are thought how to solve best with game theory. The most known game to me is Prisoner's dillema. I think the problem is trying to capture what is a best decision to take where you don't have the knowledge what about your oponent will do."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"The interaction is about the choices we make in life and the risks involved. It suggests that we often have to decide whether to give or receive, and that these decisions can be either assertive or not. Assertiveness is the ability to express your needs and wants in a clear and direct way, without being aggressive or passive. When we are assertive, we are more likely to get what we want and need. However, there is always a risk involved in making decisions, and we may not always get the outcome we want."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think you try to make an experiment in which you would like to test the if the two parties are willing to lift on one other. By holding instead of passing you will receive eather 10 tokens or 22. By passing the amount you could receive is less, eather 8 or 15. By choosing hold tou can maximize the amiunt of tokens you potentialy receive. "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"It's all about cooperation. If you pass the ball to each other correctly, you can maximize your joint profits over and over again. If it's only one round, you can decide either way, since the expected value is always 15. It's unpredictable"
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"i can't think of a real life example, but i just don't have enough trust to believe in somebody else's good faith, and i don't want to be the one to get less money. Karma is a bitch"
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of investing in stocks. You have to know when to invest, hold or sell your assets to make profit."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This game reminded me of a team cooperation game. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to win more
Male,b,BCG,Pass,A cooperation problem for example in traffic when you choose to give someone else priority at an intersection when the situation is unclear. You may never see them again and it would save you time to take priority (hold). But ceding priority (passing) is beneficial to everyone when done reciprocally.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of when I have to sharing something with my brother, it means that, where we both receive the same, or he receives the total and I get nothing, since for me it is preferable that my little brother receives everything than that he receives nothing"
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of trust in people. We can either be selfish and earn less or be together and make better progress in a shorter time
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think this exercise is to try to understand if people are selfish and to what extent they trust another person for a common goal
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of the game goldenballs split or steal. It is probably trying to capture the selfishness of human beings. From my daily life it reminds me of choosing whether to help others at my own expense.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I find it easier to just go with my gut reaction when i have a difficult choice to make. Sometimes if you ruminate and overthink a decision you can make a choice that you regret. There is less to lose if you make a decision spontaneously.i think the problem is trying to find out what kind of person you are.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me gambling, where the amount you win on a bet influences your decision to bet again. It also reminds me of stock trading, which is a bit similar, and whether you invest again will depend on the return you make. I can't think of a situation where how much money you make is directly related to the decision of one person though."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of how decisions I make just do not affect me but others when I'm at work. In being part of a team, my work contributes to the team's success but can also lead to personal success and bonuses. I can be awarded for my personal success but can also work hard and have another person be awarded a bonus in the team, basically showing how the excessive work culture for recognition is a gamble."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me the situation when we have to decide whether to hold our decision on a short term profit situation or proceed with a possible risk but gaining higher profit from that situation. It all depends on the the persons involved. If we think thoughtfully, In the future we both win from the right decision. It is trying to capture the bargaining interaction between two people."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"This interaction resembles strategic decision making in various real life situations, such as negotiations or cooperative ventures. For example in trading, you risk some money, to get potential profit. There is a possibility that it won't go as you wanted to, but considering potential risk to win ratio, you decide what will be your choice"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds of that saying that if you do a good action, and the next person also does a good action, that you are sharing good and faith to other people, and I also think this is what it's trying to capture."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"For me, it's about choosing to be self-serving or being a teammate. How your choices impact others. It's also reminding me of our risk appetite. "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,In my opinion this interaction is trying to check how I understand the system. Also it is checking how well I understand what I have read. It reminds me a time when I was in primary school and I had to read a text and then answer a questions about it.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I view it similar to ""nothing changes if nothing changes"". Meaning, if you want to do something and involve someone else, you both should put in joint effort cooperate so that the results at the end are worthwhile for both of you. Also, ""teamwork makes the dreamwork""."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of when you buy new food to try and you dont like it that much but do you like what your friend bought so you try to convince him to swap plates without him knowing it is because you actually didnt like it. 
Male,a,BCG,Pass,It is like a negotiation where two things decide wheter to hold their current resources or to pass some resources so it can benefits the both. It is like a business and personal relantionships. It shows a lot about the dynamic of decision/making
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"it reminds me of crypto exchanges, investing money and  trying not to lose ur money capital. Also it reminds me of risk management and everyday life situation when you have to decide between many things like either u wanna hold something that is very valuable for it to be more or sell it to gain money."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I am a student and when going to exercises, in order to get bonuses for being active, you must register. I have trouble speaking in front of large numbers of people. When i know the answer to a question, I often feel embarased to answer it  and while waiting, someone will be a jerk and already answer and get a point. Then, sometimes it happens only that there is another question to which I also know the exact answer. If I were more open and brave, I would answer the question and get a plus."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,How people work together and share equally or if they would rather be selfish and look to gain more at the expense of others
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"knowing that in our daily lives we go through many situations in which we have to decide whether to stay or not, in workplace for example, this interaction has a similarity for me with salary increases or job offers. Working together and cooperating."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It somehow reminds me of driving a car in traffic. I know it sounds unrelated, but the basic concept of trusting other parties in a mutually beneficial outcome is technically based on the same principle. Also it might refer to a general trust towards peers and people you encounter in your everydays."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think this relates to the choices I make regarding studying or procrastinating. If I procrastinate, my knowledge remains the same, whereas if I choose to study, I gain more knowledge and I would be able to apply the intial knowledge at a higher level. "
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of times when I have to take risks making decisions when gambling. When playing in teams others tend to be selfish because everybody wants to gain something. This interaction reminds me of how some people gain and how others don't depending on one's choice. Afterall, gambling is a win loose at the end of the day.."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Maybe about cooperation with people from work or from the environment, that by working together and taking risks we can gain more?"
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"it reminds me of the concept of borrowing and interest. It also reminds one of the subject of trust, in situations where finances and other people or entities involved."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"In my opinion this game feels a little bit like the card game ""Uno"", because we can't see what the other person is doing or what kind of cards they have. I think this game tries to see how much a person is willing to sacrifice in order to win bigger rewards. It might also want to see how 2 people interact with each other in a strategic game if they don't know anything about each other's moves."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I think this experiment is trying to capture what happens in our every day society, in other words, it seems to capture how trust towards each other works, if i trust someone sends me money, i will ""trust"" the next person i pass too to keep passing the money, if everyone thinks the same way, eventually i will receive more money.."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,The problem is how long players will pass before one of them keeps all the chips. The main issue is trust and greed. How long can I trust the other player to trust me? Can I stop myself from taking all the chips?
Female,b,BCG,Pass,It reminds me of workplace some situations  (specially in the academic and working scopes)to achieve individual goals. 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"There is no specific real-life situation that reminds me of the above interaction. If I don't take this task literally, it can feel like a kind of team game. I mean, when my partner and I choose the same answer, we will receive the same reward. "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Whether to start a relationship (with a friend, a coworker, or 'my' employee) by giving full trust in their capability or by skeptical about it first."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I think that the interaction is trying to capture how a person will make decision when provided with two choices. Will he choose a safe route or interesting route that allows him to expect more.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"In life, you have to make choices on whether or not to take risks. Sometimes, the risks can benefit others more than yourself. You have to make the decision of whether or not you want to take the risk, with not just yourself in mind. "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,in my opinion this interaction is meant to indicate wheter participants want to share some goods equally or they will choose to gain more than the first participant. Unfortunatley this activity does not remind me any interaction from real life.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I think the game involves working as a team for both players to get the best out of it. If one player does not share then the whole team would be let down and individuals would also become selfish and not share.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I think its trying to emulate how to achieve an optimal situation for both parties involved and whether we can reach a conclusion that is good for both. Its trying to see if given the opportunity, people would choose to benefit everyone evenly or gaining an advantage at the behest of another person. "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"I associate it with the interaction of two people, in cases of term investments, one of them being the person with the money and the second the one with the contacts, in which you can win or lose when investing (A) and B can be a scammer or an honest person who takes his due share of the investments"
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"In my opinion, this situation resembles situations from everyday life, and specifically it says that we have a greater chance of making a profit by choosing the common good than by looking only at ourselves. At the same time, a sense of empathy should be aroused - if one of the parties focuses on their own benefit, the other may gain nothing"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I believe that this interaction is about the tendency (or lack thereof) to seek a mutual good, even if it comes with a (slight in this case) personal cost. Thus, this interaction becomes one of trust, where A can cede its capital to B, and B can choose to ""beat"" A or for both to benefit."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think is is a risk reward based scenario and the one who passes quickly takes the guaranteed amount is less risk prone, while the one who holds is willing to hold out for more. This could be a way of measuring mindfulness or an individual's sense of security or value of money. A mindful person knows it is an exercise where money one didn't contribute is wagered and the benefit is no loss or a nice gain. Where as a more reactive mind would take the quick win. "
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of team work and how working together with honesty yields results, while the results are opposite if one team member drags their feet. one person's actions affects all in a group setting and thus one must be mindful of their decisions as it affects others. Team work is the dream work as a wise man once said."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"I believe this study aims to understand how people behave when they find themselves in a situation where the final outcome, in this case an investment, doesn't solely depend on them. Specifically, there are two possibilities: whether people prefer to ""hold"" the token, thus having more chance of a good investment even if part B doesn't do a ""good"" action, or if they ""trust"" part B knowing they might end up losing their investment?  This question can be applied in many areas of everyday life: do I prefer to do things on my own, knowing I might have a ""poorer"" outcome, or do I trust a second person, with the possibility that they might take advantage of me?"
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It doesn't remind me of something in particular. Perhaps this interaction is trying to capture situations like these: for example, when you invest money in some business projects or when you invest in stock market. The role of the couterpart though seems a little less relevant and something I can't evaluate."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"Playing around pass is safe option, playing around pass is potentially better, and beeing egotistical and selfish while being b is an immoral one"
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I think that the described problem resembles the prisoners dilemma. One has to decide for a safe option or a more risky one which, in the event of an unfavorable choice by the other player, may bring more losses than benefits. As for the similarity to my private life, I think it resembles a situation in which giving up some of my own profit can bring me benefits if the other person also decides to do so."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,Giving money to someone and then them giving some of it back to you. I think this could happen with a family member who you lend money to and you√¢¬Ä¬ôd expect them to give some back to you.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"How to make the best benefit from the action/activities , for example: if you have a chance to earn extra money by bidding one stuff online or do you want those time to do other thing to get the best result?how to deal with different scenarios and form your own strategy ."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me that the decisions we make impact others lives and vice versa. We are suppose to wheigt every decisions carefully. This also reminds me that sometimes there's nothing i can do to change the situation, because the power off the decision it's not on our hands."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,It tries to capture the spirit of cooperation. It is similar to working with a team. It is easier to accomplish something or to make more ( for example more progress) when we are working together.  It is better to work together.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I think this is about the well-known ""PrisonersDilemma"". This dilemma explores human individuality and the ability for cooperation between two parties. What I remember is that this dilemma suggests two individuals won't cooperate even though doing so would benefit them both. This is because people always seek their own benefit before the common good, especially if there's no trust within the √îdilemma√ï. This distrust√ëbelieving the other person won't act for mutual benefit but rather their own gain, consequently harming the other√ëcauses both parties to make a less beneficial choice."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,The last question I had to answer was to Hold or Pass. But no where were those terms used. There was Loan and Return SO I am unsure as to what it meant that Person A passed to me??  I think it's trying to capture people's level of greed and risk.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I think that the main topic of this task was about egoism and level of risk we are able to take. Also about trust in others when we are talking about profit for someone else not only for ourselfs. But it doesn't reminds me anything from my daily life
Male,b,BCG,Hold,If you have a problem and you dont want to solve it just pass it to the other person it will stack and have like a snowball effect. You have to think
Female,a,BCG,Pass,It remind me of gambling. I like to play lottery and it remind of me that. I Can play and maybe win but of someone already played the ticket I am wanting to play than I will more than likely loose 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of any interaction in which someone could choose to benefit only themself, to help another person, or to help themself and another person. It doesn't bring up an association with any one particular event that I can think of. I think it is trying to capture an understanding of how willing people are to trust others and/or to be selfish or share."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"Similar to life, its a gamble when you give others something of yours whether thats money or objects. Its a gamble whether youll get it back or be disappointed "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of playing games online.  I would always try to keep the pot going.  I usually would end up getting screwed because I don't want to take coins from someone else. 
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I decided to hold, because I want to able to keep my tokens as much as I can. I also do not want to pass completely yet until I see my opponents moves first. I don't trust unknown parties"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,Its trying to understand how cooperative people might be and how much they will risk money with others unknown. Its commonly called as prisoners dilema. We can both profit if we trust each other. 
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"If I understood correctly, I would win for sure if I passed. If I held there was a chance of receiving more, but also a chance of complete loss. It's about not being a jerk"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of sharing with my community by donating goods and money to those in need. If I decide to hold things, then they don't get passed on. If I donate and others do as well, the contribution grows. It wants to capture if we'll be generous or greedy. "
Female,b,BCG,Hold,This was honestly confusing. But ultimately think its about how your decisions can affect others possibly. Sort of being nice or a jerk
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think its about trust. I am perfectly willing to take a loss of five tokens if someone else trusted me with five tokens. Why would I be a jerk?
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"Maybe gambling, I guess. Is this supposed to resemble the stock market?"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"the pay off of doing something early being able to have a better payoff later, like preparing a meal earlier in the week being able to save you time later, or on a larger scale; getting an oil change taking up time now vs. not and having to deal with possibly damaging your car to the point of having to buy a new vehicle all together. It's simply risk versus reward; given that the other event actually pulls off what  is needed to make the 'pay off' event happen.  "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I think thi sis trying to capture critical thinking to ensure that you would do something similar in real life if something like this scenarios arose.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"Maybe it tries to capture people's gambling strategies of managing their money based on data from other players. In addition, the survey may tries to capture the thinking strategies of customer's decision making in products based on other people's choices. Also, this interaction reminds me of daily transactions in customer service."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This reminds me of my daily life, because I have to make decisions to move forward with the game. You can make a decision to hold or pass similarly to what I do in my life one needing to decide on important decisions.. I think this is trying to capture the reality of what people need to go through."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I think that the interation portrays selfishness. If both people are selfless, then both people get a reward higher than the base token amount. If one player is selfish, they get an even higher reward, but the other person gets nothing. It is mutually beneficial for both players to make a small sacrifice, but it is a test of human nature to see if one player will leave the other with nothing and take it all for themselves."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of the interaction between socioeconomic classes. Specifically taxes perhaps. While I don't fully understand how it works, I think it points to how people's selfishness affect others. If one is distrustful of another's motive or assuming they other person will be greedy, they will try to preserve themselves. If one has faith or compassion for the other, they are most willing to extend that choice of deciding for us both. It speaks to the nature of a capitalist society in which many do not have the experience or luxury of being able to trust or rely on others with the other expecting something in return."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I think it is trying to capture generosity vs. selfishness. If you are A and choose to hold, you are guaranteed tokens (selfish) vs. if you pass (share) you may either get more tokens, or less depending on your partner. But, it should feel good to share and that is the prize,"
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of lending money to a friend who has some investment idea. They come to me with an idea and ask for money to fund it. They promise that they might make me a lot of money, or they might run off with all the money."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I think this game is about sharing and helps calm my life down. knowing there is someone else on the other side playing as well makes it about sharing.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,How people behave around others and try to maximize their personal benefit in risk oriented situations.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I believe this interaction is trying to measure levels of altruism. For some reason, it reminded me of hopscotch. I believe it was the ""pass"" aspect of the game. "
Female,a,BCG,Hold,It kind of reminds me how team cooperation can get more result together than working by yourself.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,The leap frog of financial markets. One ammount leaping another and either growing or shrinking. A tiny scale of society but just a sliver.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"When we deny our own personal selfish afflictions other people get to benefit? I think its a test of compassion and reward. However, the real test was letting me know that they passed first. That made the decision easy versus someone who wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know that and is in position A. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,In this game its best for both contestants to pass. If you both pass youll both earn some money its about being considerate and fair towards others. If you hold as person A its being quite greed.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I think it's trying to capture if I should do what's best for ME specifically or what's best overall. It's usually petter for the induvial to hold, but better overall if everyone passes."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,It reminds me that a lot of people are selfish. It makes me hope that both partners will work toward the common good. It (sadly) reminds me of people complaining about masks during COVID.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I am not totally sure what this interaction is trying to remind me of. Maybe some sort of investing or gambling (though hopefully gambling isn't apart of peoples daily lives but that is a different convo). I honestly am not very sure what this is trying to mimic
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"Both of us are taking surveys for money on Prolific. Whatever small amount means a lot to either of us, so I want the best outcome and fair for the both of us."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of a situation in which if 2 parties do something in the interest of the other person, they both come out ahead. This is the foundational principle of capitalism. For example someone selling something on ebay. If someone wants to get rid of something and would rather have some money, and someone else wants that thing and is willing to pay for it, and they both willingly engage in the transaction, then they both win."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,it seems like it has to do with seeing how greedy someone is or how much you trust others to do the right thing. holding guarantees you have a set amount because you can't trust that person b will also pass. 
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This doesn't remind me of anything specifically from my daily life, but I think it's trying to capture whether people trust others or not (e.g., if A doesn't trust the other person, they're most likely to hold). It could also be trying to capture how generous someone is. For example, if B is passed to and they choose to also pass, they can be seen as generous because both parties receive the same amount of tokens."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I was thinking about how this activity is similar to helping those in need, giving away something small of mine with the opportunity to help someone else less fortunate"
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I think it is trying to maybe evaluate intrinsic greed and whether we are capable of putting our wants aside to ensure everyone in the room gets their fair share.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,People doing things for the benefit of a larger group as opposed to solely personal gain vice versa
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I don't know what this has to do with daily life, but I'm guessing it's trying to figure out how much people trust strangers to maximize their winnings versus if they are greedy and try to take all the tokens without thinking of the other person. It also could be related to risk taking behavior. "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,it reminds me of the stock market with risky vs safer investments.  the riskier option has a higher payout if it pays off but is more damaging when it doesnt.  the safer option is more consistent in its returns whether it pays off or not
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"trying to see if I give up a higher benefit to myself for an equal benefit for both parties. If I hold I keep the money, but if I share we each get a slightly lesser amount than I get if I held. However, I also not screwing over my partner, and both of us still get to win, if I return."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This game seems confusing to me. The only best option available is to pass so both parties receive the best outcome. It seems like a negotiation in a business setting. If both parties compromise somewhat then they both win. In today's political climate where neither party is willing to compromise or negotiate, everyone loses especially their constituents and the citizens of the US. This is what this scenario reminds me of the most. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,It reminds me of sharing with others in real life to gain more than the initial value by combining each others value to have more value in the end.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I believe it is trying to figure our peoples generosity versus selfishness.  Are people willing to just take when given something or are they willing to give to help someone else? This may also help the giver in some way.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I believe that this decision interaction is trying to capture the idea of how companies work. A higher up can choose to either keep their money, or distribute it amongst workers and potentially earn more for everyone. It is testing morals."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds of if peope are giving, people tend to follow suit. If one person becomes selfish, all memebers dont trust and tend to be that way theirselves"
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"This is probably trying to remind me of teamwork and trusting your teammate to take a wise decision with you. Even when he could hold the tokens and get everything, the correct answer should be to distribute the earnings."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think that this decision requires a lot of trust from both sides. Each person needs to trust that a stranger will work in the best interest of both and not only for their own benefit. I think it is trying to capture how people will work socially, whether they will choose to work together for the benefit of all, or if they will only look out for themselves in order to profit as much as possible."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think the interaction is hoping to inspire, or at least test, collaboration between people.  It is best for everyone  to do the loan and return, which nets 30 tokens total.  The other options only net 20 or 10 tokens.  So hopefully people can cooperate for an ideal outcome."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This makes me think time of time and balancing different chores that need to be done or going out with friends. If I choose chores,  I may not win points with my friend but I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt lose. If I go out with friends, we have other decisions to make like if it's just dinner or drinks or something else."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"Not much in my daily life but it's an example of cooperation. We can both improve our lot by investing, but he can also exploit my doing so for even more personal gain. Kind of like the prisoner's dilmemna"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I think it really is similar of the idea of fairness in transactions and dealings with people. Do you choose to selfishly take more? or do you try to split it. It's sort of a trust exercise snatch or steal basically.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I don't really understand this to be honest. If I start with a penny and hold I'd have a penny.  If I pass then they would have two pennies.  I don't really understand where the 10, 15, 8, 22 are all coming from.  I must be moral I guess"
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"I can't make any comparisons to real life, but I think its trying to capture how humans are likely to share something they have or not based on outocme."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,It is trying to capture how selfish and selfless people are toward strangers. It is about cooperation for the best payoff for everyone. It will show you what kind of person you are. 
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It does not remind me of anything in my daily life. It may be trying to capture negotiation or competition for limited resources where cooperation may or may not be rewarded. These problems are never so simple though.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of having to split work between a team. If I decide to take the bulk of the work the rest of the team does not have to contribute much. But if we split it equally, there is equal benefit in the end."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of whether or not you should trust in people. A cynic would probably not believe in the good in people and instead take the 5. A hopeful would pass, and believe in the person to hold."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"I dont gamble, but I see games like this when visiting certain clubs. I also see it in online forums. Its gambling"
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of a game of chicken from gametheory, where one person must decide whether to hold their position. The game is similar in the sense that both strategies have different potential payoffs, but choosing to hold both maintains the current position, while choosing to pass can potentially lead to a better outcome for both parties. However, there is also a risk involved in passing, as the other party may also choose to pass, resulting in a less desirable outcome for both. This interaction seems to capture the trade-off between taking a risk for a possible better outcome and playing it safe to maintain what you currently have. "
Female,a,BCG,Hold,I think this is trying to capture team work in a work setting. If a person you're working with decides to hold on to a project then nothing happens and if you also hold maybe you will benefit but they will not 
Male,a,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of a time when my mother asked me to split my allowance with my brother.  She wanted me to split it equally with him if we both did our chores.  I only gave him 2 dollars and I kept 3.  My mom found out and gave all of my allowance to my brother.  I think this interaction was trying to see if we could have trust and have faith in one another to do the right thing.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This pattern reminds me of short term vs long term rewards and gratification. If A and B both work together, they are both rewarded. If either A or B is selfish, only one party benefits."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of negotiation or decision-making situations where both parties have to make a choice without knowing the other party's decision. Depending on the choices made, one party might end up with more resources than the other. It could also represent a situation of risk-taking where one party has to decide whether to hold onto a smaller but guaranteed amount of resources or take a chance to potentially gain more."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"With those that are person A, it seems like the interaction is determining how much trust they put in other people based on if they pass of not.  Another aspect is if there is a certain amount of points that would change their mind between holding and passing.  It seems like a bit more of a tough decision for person B because they have the choice to take away points from the other player.   "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I believe its the common idea of sharing is caring. Greed usually comes back in a form of karma. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I can't think of any specific example, but I assume it could be like paying someone to manage investments for you. If you pay someone and they were to just keep the money then you lose it all and they gain it all. If they actually invest it and it is successful then you make more money and they likely get a cut of it which also makes them more money then they started with."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It's like the prisonersdilemma, where one person can essentially rob the other that they put their trust in, or they can be fair and share the prize equally. Ultimately it tries to capture people's true motivations greed. I don't feel like this applies to my daily life because I wouldn't make that kind of decision asynchronously, at least not by choice."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"This interaction could mirror interaction in day to day life where the task is passed off from one person to another. I could choose to complete the task on my own for a lesser result, or I could have someone else help me with part of it and trust them to put in the work for the best result possible. "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think that regardless I will be given some money for this and hopefully the other counterpart will be doing the same. It reminds me of when i work.  i can hold certain things and given some credit or i can share with the enstire team, we can do the work and we can all get an evenly distributed amount of praise. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,This decision problem and interaction potentially reminds me of many other interactions that I often encounter in life. It requires myself and another person to both pass on something to achieve a better result rather than do something that if we both do it we both get the same as what we already have. Essentially we can either continue as we are or we can make a decision to get something better.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,Maybe trying to capture one's trust in others to do things that can possibly benefit others?
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I'm not certain what this interaction is trying to capture. Perhaps it's related to taxes and/or social programs. It could be related to income redistribution.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This seems like something similar to gametheory. I think it is trying to capture two individuals being selfish and ending with nothing, or willing to share and both benefit. It is a test to human nature and trust."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,This interaction gives me the feeling of putting the ball in someone elses court to make the best decision for the team. Sometimes you have to trust someone else to make the decision. I think most people usually chose the outcome to benefit both parties involved.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This reminds me of investments and how people together make stocks/crypto go up. or down, Other peoples decisions affect you whether you like it or not. this was very reminiscent of that."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of the risk/reward ratio in trading. I'm having trouble relating this to my daily life - perhaps giving and taking within a relationship.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"How when you give youll always receive something in return. Little bit like karma or morality. Also you wont be sad forever, happiness is always around the corner."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I have a job and have had many others. If a person can take an action that benefits themself only and ruins things for everyone else then they most always will. I won't be surprised if exactly that happens today.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"It's a version of the prisoners dilemma, the optimal outcome is one which effectively comes only when both participants choose to make themselves vulnerable to selfish behaviour on the part of the other, and where when evaluated only from selfish motives and individual perspective, choosing the selfish option seems potentially preferable.  Any situation involving trust is is mirrored by this scenario."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,This interaction remind me of investments we make in everyday such as investing time with the right people hoping that they will pay off later.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I think in a way it reminds me of teamwork in the professional setting. When you are working in a job such as an office job, you have to take into account how you and your coworkers can help each other. This is similar in the sense that one's decision is dependent on the other."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,Think it seeing if people think more about themselves or as a group. It is also some trust that the other person isn't going to keep thr higher amount. Is the risk of losing worth the chance of gaining.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of capitalism and wealth hoarding. In a world where there are actually resources enough for everyone, some people deliberately choose to hoard what could be shared. It's the difference between one player ending up with substantially more than the other, when another choice allows both players to get equally ahead. I'm thinking of billionaires who could do so much good by redistributing their wealth, while still retaining more money than one could ever need, and they choose not to."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,To be selfless and build wealth. Its better to build together then alone. You will never know the potential if you hault and be selfish.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"I think this interaction is trying to capture how people would react in such a scenario by seeing if they will try to help just themselves or both people. The decision and the demographics of the player can give some data that can possibly give some common patterns. The closest thing similar from my daily life to this interaction would be me and a coworker working on a project at work, and while we can work together evenly, someone can decide to put in more work than the other to get more credit."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"Everybody would make more money if they worked together and passed.  However, I have noticed in these games on prolific it's everyman for himself.  We see a lot of that in society.  So, you have to take care of yourself."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to capture whether someone will trust an unknown entity with their money. This consists of passing under the impression that someone else will also pass at a small expense to them. By person B passing it will show that they are capable of sacrificing a little for someone else to gain more making the two equal
Male,a,BCG,Hold,It just reminds me of that inner battle of wanting to do what's right for others but also optimizing what we do for ourselves.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,In my humble opinion this interaction is about wealth distribution. Most likely about the effect of sharing with others and how this can grow your wealth. Choosing not to be greedy can pay off sometimes.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This reminds me of trust exercises. If someone chooses a greedy option, the total output is lowered. The point is for people to work together to achieve the maximum output."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I found myself wondering if the risk of potentially receiving a lower payoff by passing was worth it. It requires you to trust another persons judgement and proclivity for being self serving. It reminds me of collective studying in college (both parties could potentially receive a better grade if resources are shared equally).  
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction is like investment. If you decide to continually invest your money, it grows but it ends when the money or investments stops. "
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of a  bargaining interaction.  Where both players are probably trying to come out with the most tokens.  It also reminds me of a lottery type game.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I think it could be a demonstration of trust in strangers and coming up with something more than what we had before by trusting them. I could compare this to working on an important task at work with someone you've not worked with before and don't know that well. By giving them part of the work and trusting they will do it, then you task will be better than if you had done it yourself if they also trust and care about you."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of the UK show on the goldenballs and split or steal scenario. It is trying to gauge intent for mutual gain versus maximum individual gain i.e. ""we both get some vs more for me"". "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of how we need to trust people to make decisions that benefits the majority of the group, rather than just themselves. Even though the option of benefiting yourself over others is tempting, it comes with the consequences of you being seen as selfish, untrustworthy and in the future you might miss some opportunities over it. "
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"I think this interaction is about choices and the benefit/payout ratio for oneself and others. We make choices weighing our ethics in terms of what will be most beneficial to ourselves and to others. Some try to balance the two, while others try to capitalize primarily for the self at the expense of others. Still, there are those and situations where the benefit to the other is the driving factor. Additionally, I feel that this highlights how considering others can actually increase north benefit to the self and to the other, thereby maximizing the aggregate benefit."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I really don't know. Maybe buying and selling on the web where if I choose to loan merchandise to a distributor, they return some of the profit to me. Possibly selling something on consignment would be another option. "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"As we navigate through our daily lives, we are often faced with such decisions as this interaction. we are constantly trying to make desicions that either maximise our own earnings  or be considerate of our fellow collegue and make desicions that benefits the group or both of us. Such decisions sometimes creates a delimma."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I was try to wake up happy with more energy and to go at work without moody face. I was waiting to come the summer the hot air and the sun and every time which work off and go home I like to capture the dawn
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This interaction represents daily decision making to do things that are out of routine. You could choose the safe option (holding) and know that the outcome will be positive. However, you also have the option to take risk and try something that could end badly, but also have a positive gain. You can't control the outcome after passing because the output depends on the next player. It symbolizes that you can make your own decision, but what happens after is out of your hands."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,The only thing I can think of is the fact that we often have to count on others and are often screwed over. This also makes me think who is actually fare and who is not when working with other. I often get taken advantage of when trying to be fare.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"The dichotomy of greed vs generosity. From the perspective of B, it is whether to immediately take the most you can without regard for anyone else. And from the perspective of A it is whether to trust that the person in role B will value you have 15 tokens more than they value themselves having an extra 5."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think it may be about fairness. I believe it is about being willing to compromise so that everyone benefits instead of just one person. One person could be selfish and benefit greatly or be more selfless so that others get to benefit as well. 
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"Seems to be associated with a game of trust where both ends have something to gain from should everything go accordingly to plan but one of the subjects involved has more power on this exchange and has the possibility to keep everything. This scenario doesn't remind me of a particular interaction on my daily life, but what i imagined was some sort of repair service where the one capable of repair has the possibility to keep the item. However fixing it will result in that person being payed and the original owner to have the item fixed."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me a lot about how we think about community and those around us. If we all chip in and contribute to the greater good we can reach a result that satisfies everyone, without being greedy. This reminded of of some public discourse I have been hearing about taxes, for the upcoming election. I am a firm believer of a public system and I think we all should contribute to the greater good. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This was an interesting decision, it's similar to rock-paper-scissors. I would rather share the funds than risk everyone getting $0. This is a reflection of my daily life because I am not a selfish or greedy person."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It is trying to capture if some people will be greedy enough to keep the tokens even if it is small. Some would pass to the other person, so they can get a split share, but there are some people that would just keep the tokens to themselves, and not share any. That's what I think it is trying to capture."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I believe this interaction is trying to capture the benefit of investment and liquidity within the free markets. When more people invest their money in the markets, more individuals are able to benefit. It is about the balance of risk vs reward and total benefit gained from risk. If both actors in the interaction choose to invest/loan their money, more is created that can subsequently grow, perpetuating a growing economy. When we hold our money it cause the economy to stagnate and only some people benefit. "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,This reminds me of a profit sharing scenario. A scenario where a team of people can either invest together or pull out and take each others' money. It shows how people look to interact and share with one another given additional monetary opportunities.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"Oh, this decision thingy feels like trying to negotiate a deal at work. You gotta decide whether to stick to your guns or give a little to get what you want. It's like a game of strategy, and you gotta think ahead to anticipate the other person's moves."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction kinda reminds me of playing poker with my friends. You gotta decide whether to play it safe or take a risk, and you never know what the other person's gonna do. It's all about reading the situation and making the best move you can."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,Im thinking for some reason when it comes to making sacrifices. Making sacrifices for something of value can have added benefits like family. Spending time with family can be a worthwhile sacrifice instead of working all the time.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"hold or pass reminds me of an interaction from my daily life. when me and my buddys were playing bingo back in high school. we didnt do it often, and one of my friends was going to bet on a number. one of my friends decided not to bet on the same number and save his money. a few days later, the friend who bet his money won $50 from the number he bet on. it reminded me because he didnt hold his money."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I feel this interaction reminds me of the way opportunities are spread amongst people. These captures that there are many opportunities to build together. It is all about how you approach the opportunity.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,This reminds of team work task. It also reminds of see how more person√¢ decisions can influence the decision of someone else. I think this will help capture a look at the mindset of someone working with others. 
Male,a,BCG,Hold,My initial thought was a stock related scenario. Investing your money into stocks to watching it grow. Another is gambling in what you think your counterpart will do and trusting in them to do the right thing. 
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"I think its trying to measure selfishness. There is an opportunity for two people to do well or one person to do a little bit better, and the other a lot worse so theres clearly an option where someone makes a small sacrifice to help someone."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I try to think of something, but nothing is coming to mind as I do not have these types of interactions with people. I think it is trying to get people to trust each other for greater rewards."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This isn't currently reminding me of anything in daily life. I may be mistaken, but this reminds me of the prisonersdilemma. Otherwise, I guess it's being rewarded for being willing to share. "
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I think that this interaction is getting intel on how people react with strangers in regards to monetary and opportunities. I think this is trying to emulate what it would be like if someone found a wallet on the ground or something like that. 
Female,a,BCG,Hold,I think this is trying to capture how people will make choices if only it favors them and not the other party. Which means majority of our life choices is based on what favors us without consideration of the next person around us.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction is likely meant to emulate how people decide what is worth risk or not, and to what extent. It is kind of similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma, especially as there is no communication between the two sides. I guess beyond just ""lottery"" psychology, it's analyzing economics, and how people weigh risks and rewards."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"It makes me think of meeting new people and blindly trusting them. You never know what someone's true intentions are in relation to you. It also makEs me think of having a limited amount of money and having to take a risk that could possibly add to the amount, or take away from what you have."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of when you are at the store. Sometimes when you check out they will ask if you want to round up for a charity. I think that the token problem reminds me of deciding to round up for the charity or not.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,I honestly have no idea. I just went with my gut response. I guess it seem like something related to gametheory or the stock market?
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Im a stay at home mom. Sharing is not always necessary but makes life a lot nicer and easier. I try to get that message in my kids heads daily. I tell them one of these days you might need some help, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs nice to make friends before that day."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,Probably see my reasoning on making this decision on whether holding as A versus passing as A is worth it at the end.  I thought Holding is the correct play because if B decides to pass then I'm most likely to end up with 15 for both so both win win versus Pass in beginning and either getting 20 or 0. You can risk it.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of my relationship in my daily life. I am constantly trying to figure out what my partner is going to say and or do to see what my own move will be. 
Female,a,BCG,Hold,it is replicating a gambling game. it is to determine how wealth is moved around and decided upon. player a has the ultimate control over how the money moves in the game. like how money moves in real life
Male,a,BCG,Pass,This doesn't really remind me of anything in my daily life. I'm not entirely sure what this is trying to capture. Perhaps it's about whether or not people tend to be more greedy or more charitable.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This situation reminds me of how people investing money or privilege. People who get things ""passed"" on to them like an inheritance (on an individual level) or a good economy (on a societal level) should do what's necessary to make sure it passes to the next generation, even if they take a bit less themselves."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,The idea is to mimic the idea of trust and holding out for long term goals for an investment. These are skills necessary to build a long term strategy for investing your money.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,it reminds me of work. you have to decide to either better yourself or the company 
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of situations where you have to decide if you'd rather share the wealth or keep more for yourself. When you pass something along, you're working with someone so that you both benefit from it."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I think it is trying to capture how the impact of decisions. Even when you make decisions for yourself it still has an impact on other people. Similarly, other people's decisions can affect your outcomes too, even though you had nothing to do with it."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of how much more money society would have if billionaries were taxed more. If they gave up some of their money, others would benefit and so would they. And it's a nice back and forth."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,Its like making a donation to an organization which benefits the community in a way that magnifies the donation value by improving society√¢and enabling more community members to benefit all around. By contribution go to a community good the value is shared and some of the value is felt by the giver either tangibly or intangibly in some way. The donor feels better about helping others and those others in turn may go on to do good deeds or donate in some way to help the previous donors. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs also like paying it forward or how we√¢¬Ä¬ôre taxed to cover services for those in need to become improved community members who in turn contribute.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to capture peoples responses to risk. It reminds me of deciding if I give more effort will it payoff in the long run for me.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I suppose that this is a sharing situation in which we are trying to decide if player B is selfish or not, based on player A initial move. "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of team work and decisions making, in our daily activities we shouldn't neglect how our actions have consequences and it could eith go on to favor us or go against us "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It is trying to decide whether people will act  in best interest for themselves or morally for the group at large
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This interaction would remind me of strategic ways to invest or hold on an investment platforms. It can go way down on how investments plans are made.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me of all of daily life - of the way the world seems to operate - as if it were a zero sum game and there isn't enough for everyone. We've been led to believe in a scarcity mindset, that there isn't enough for everyone. So, instead of sharing (like in this game and taking 15 each), we take as much as we can."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This is a way to see our perceived generosity. I reminds me of how we  treat those around us, some people choose to be selfish, while others are more generous. We typically are more inclined to be helpful to those who are nice to us and trust us than those who trust themselves only."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"Balancing ego with fairness seems to be the goal. Reminds me of learning to exist in a society. And, the scenario replicates the conflict of selfishness."
Female,a,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of stocks that occur daily. I think it is trying to capture the risks and payoffs of what stocks are and how they work.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"It reminds me about trust and cooperation. Many scenarios come down to depending on another person to have your best interests at heart. If two people work together than they can both benefit but if they choose to be selfish, no one really wins. "
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I think this interaction is trying to capture the amount of trust I have in strangers. Do I trust them to be benevolent and kind towards me if I am kind towards them? Do I believe they will make the choice that will profit me as well, or keep the profit to themselves?"
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"I think that this interaction is trying to capture that ever decision has its own consequences attached to it. You can choose to depend on people or just choose to be alone and risk it all. It reminds me of working in partners and having to depend on others, even if you do not know them. I also think that it teaches you about gambling and stocks, in which I go to financial and business oriented college and hear about stocks a lot."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction resembles scenarios in decision-making where one must weigh the trade-offs between immediate gains and potential risks. It reflects situations where individuals must choose between holding onto a certain outcome or taking a chance for a potentially better outcome, akin to investment choices or negotiations in personal or professional settings."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I dont really know. I just choose the option that benefits us both. I want us both to recieve a payout so it can be fair for us both.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,Sort of like the suitcases game from deal or no deal. Or the MontyHall problem.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction makes me think that I'm being tested on whether to hold on to the tokens I have, or feel some risk by passing them.  The hope is that my counterpart also passes the token so the game will not end and we may end up with more tokens overall.  It feels like a game of risk."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,Thinking about the consequences others will face due to your actions is important for both players in this game. The payoff will be greater if both players pass rather than hold. Holding is also very selfish and isn't the right thing to do morally.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I guess in real life it close to where individuals or colleges need to make decisions with unknown outcomes and when they need to considering the actions of others and the potential results.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of a card game. I think it is trying to capture how well people are at collaborating with each other. It's a study on how selfish people are inside.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of the game on the price is right. Where you can take what you are initially given or you can hold out to see what is behind different doors. You risk possibly getting a greater prize or something less based on the decision you make. 
Male,a,BCG,Pass,It sounds like bargaining on a service.  Everyone will be more benefitted if they just work together.  However a lot of people will take the lesser paying easy money if they look like they won
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This feels like a gambling situation in which you must rely on a counterpart to help your gains.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This seems the safest action. If I choose Pass I'm now at the mercy of B. If B decides to maximize B's outcome, I'm screwed, and the difference is significant for B. I'd need B to pass for us both to make more money. I'm not willing to do that. I don't want to screw B, but I don't want to screw myself either."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,Giving something to someone who really needs it. How things are in real life. Give and take is very important and not greed.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,This does not really remind me of much in my daily life. I think overall its trying to calculate if people are trusting. If A passes. Will B be selfish and keep the reward or will they appreciate that A passed and thus pass again?
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"The idea of working with a team, cooperating. Working together with other people. It reminds me of how I used to work with others at work."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"I'm not entirely sure what it is trying to capture, but it seems like the dangers of investments. For example, if you do not invest, or hold, then yes your tokens will not grow, however you will still have the tokens you had initially. "
Male,a,BCG,Hold,This interaction reminds me of when my mom used to give me the choice of having a dollar daily or 20 dollars just once a month. I used to take the 20 dollars everytime not realizing her lesson. This concept is about delayed gratification.  
Female,a,BCG,Hold,"This scenario reminds me of stock trading where some one can hold and continue to drive the price and maybe get some of the reward at the higher price. However, that is dependent on the other share holders also holding the stock and not dipping the stock price."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"Where you trust someone by giving them money, but sometimes they turn their backs and dont return payment. Ive helped people out in the past, and even though I dont always expect to be appreciated, its nice to have a heartfelt thanks, or something in return. In most scenarios like this, I think people will hold."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It is a give and take in a conversation. One person invests in a person and the other peson chooses to respond and also contribute to the conversation. When both invest, the conversation is equal and both people get something out of it."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of scenario planning, and determining which alternative would be the least risk and highest return.  I am looking into side hustles to pay off debt, and I am wanting to make sure my time is used efficiently.  I also want to be sure that I am making the most money for my efforts."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,When people pay it forward at a coffee shop or other food establishment. Trying to see how often other pay it forward. 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of decisions that I have to make in life, even when I don't know what other people will do about that decision. I could choose to share and not get anything in return, or I could take a 'risk' to share and possibly get something back."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,I have no idea this is very hard for me to understand. I guess it is trying to simulate helping someone so you both benefit.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to capture what people will do in a situation where they could benefit a bit more by taking from another person or by taking a chance that the other person would also sacrifice a bit for both of them to benefit equally. I think it's trying to gauge selfishness. This interaction doesn't really remind me of anything from my daily life.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,I am actually not sure it is confusing to me. I understand the hold and pass rules involves fairness.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I believe it is trying to test how willing people are to work together to achieve something mutually beneficial. Only by working together is the best outcome for both participants possible. Role A will have to trust that Role B will act towards this best outcome, rather than selfishly act in their own interests only."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of going to a casino and gambling trying to make it big on the Poker or Blackjack table.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I think it is trying to judge if people are willing to share or turn greedy. I'm not sure how I could compare it to something in my daily life though. It is kind of a one sided thing though, 10 each if A holds but an 8 to 22 split if B holds after the A person goes. "
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I am not really sure what this interaction is trying to capture from my daily life.  I suppose that it is showing how if two people work together, it may be better for the greater good?  It seems that if you were selfish, you would get more, but there would be a bigger net gain if both sides contributed."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"A Documentary that focused on gametheory came to mind when thinking about the decision I made. In all I decided that 5 cents would not be a big loss and so I tried to maximize my potential gains and would make whichever decision allowed me to do so regardless of the possible consequences. That is what led me to pass as player B, but I would have invested the 5 tokens if I were player A."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"The game reminds me of game theory, testing the way that people interact with each other. Will the person choose fairness over selfishness? I think it's easier to choose selfishness when it's just an anonymous person on the other end"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,This interaction reminds me of gambling. One party gambles that the other party understands the possible payments. 
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I think its trying to guage the trust between two strangers. Kinda like loaning money in real life. Possibly borrowing something with the impression you may come bettwr or worse off.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,Intentionally sharing with another person so that both of us see a benefit.  I'm not sure what the intent of study is...please see below.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This decision problem reminds me of situations in daily life where trust and cooperation are essential, like in financial agreements or partnerships. It captures the dilemma of whether to take a risk and invest in a potential opportunity or to play it safe and protect one's assets. Additionally, it reflects the complexity of human relationships and the need to balance self-interest with mutual benefit for successful outcomes."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I think it is trying to see if people are willing to cooperate with other to increase their gains. If people are selfish they will ultimately lose out in life.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,I can't think of anything this reminds me of in real life. This somewhat reminds me of providing and taking out loans with friends. I'm not sure what this was trying to capture.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,How people make decisions. How knowing your decision impacts someone. How generous you are. 
Female,a,BCG,Pass,To see if you hold or pass to get more tokens.  In daily life we have to make decisions to get more or help more and I like to help more.  We have to make decisions and choices all day long and evaluate whether it is worth it or not.
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"I don't think it rminds me of anythign else, but I assume it's trying to mimic the value of delayed gratification. The benefits of being honest and moral dilemma"
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I think it is trying to capture an interaction where you can be generous, and the exchange is a gamble on whether or not you will end up with more. This is like taking time to help out a neighbor, in hopes that they will help you in a time of need."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"This interaction reminds me of the show SharkTank. When one of the investors chooses to invest in a company, they are taking a risk by putting their own money into it. If the company ends up doing really well, then both parties profit."
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of investment, you put in money and some times it takes. Other times it pays off. You never know what the risk is."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,The double it and pass it on scenario? Although it's a bit different it is somewhat of the same. It can potentially punish you for being nice while rewarding you for being greedy.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,It reminds of the effects of mutual cooperation within daily life. The idea that if two people cooperate with each other than both people can benefit equally. But that cooperation involves a measure of trust that the other person will live up to their end of the bargain and that if they don't then there is the possibility of one person losing a lot while the other person is the only one to gain.
Female,a,BCG,Hold,I think this interaction reminds me of a work related scenario where you have to try and work with someone else to determine what they will do.  I think this shows that if you work together you will reap bigger rewards.  It it trying to capture teamwork.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"making fair choices such as to cook dinner or to order out one way cooking is cheaper and ordering is more costly so I think it depends on the importance of the situation. Some decisions are easy to make and others may have to sacrifce. I feel like its also about being fair and choosing the right thing to do. so the interaction I just did I decided that I wanted to just hold because I didnt think it was fair that the other person decides what they will do, Its about trust as well , "
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to capture whether or not individuals will contribute for the greater to benefit both parties or whether or not someone will be selfish to gain more. I think it is trying to analyze whether or not people are more likely to be selfish in certain situations.  It sort of reminds me if someone continues the train of paying it forward such as paying for someone's food. 
Female,b,BCG,Hold,Banking on the fact that the person is going to do what is necessary to maximize the efficiency and assure the highest results possible for both parties. This creates a conundrum because the parties involved are total strangers and do not hold any sort of obligation or contract in order to proceed to operate. It is also possible that the other participant is a bot and will randomly pick an outcome.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I think this decision problem is trying to capture the feeling of putting trust in a complete stranger. Knowing full well that they may just keep everything and you're left with nothing, Honestly I feel that its worth the chance because only having 5 token isn't much anyways. "
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"It doesn't remind me of anything in particular. It is a game so it's like any other game. In a broader sense, it is about making moral decisions and being fair. It is about thinking of yourself and/or other people."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I had to step away briefly  now can't remember the scenario , I'm SO sorry! Seemed to be about morality and right or wrong"
Male,a,BCG,Hold,It reminds me of bitcoin where you can hold or pass on the current rate. Or economy. Collecting and selling.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"This is similar to a prisoner's dilemma scenario. If both of us pass, the total payout is the greatest, but person B could be greedy and hold for 20, so person A may want to hold for a small but guaranteed payout. This is a test of trust and greediness."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"I'm not sure. But it seems that it would depend on whether you were A or B what you would do, and it seems that the idea is to get the most you can for yourself. Unless you are an altruistic person. So maybe this is just giving examples of those two types of people."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,"By passing, there is the potential to earn more money for both me and the partner. While there is also a chance for a smaller payout, the difference was small enough for me to hope for the best. I see this situation as similar to possibly loaning small amount of money or do a small favor to a friend. There is a potential for a larger payoff, but it best serves as a way to bond with someone else."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This reminds me of the prisoners dilemma, where 2 separate people have to make a decision either for themselves or for the greater good. These instances show up when for example, I'm making a decision without my friend knowing that would either put me ahead or make it fair. I think it's trying to test what kind of people are risk-takers or more risk adverse, and also how individuals perceive people around them - if people are more suspicious of others or distrusting, they're probably less likely to pass it and take a chance on someone else's decision. "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I think it's about trusting what another person would do with their money. It's about investing I believe. How much does one person trust another person with money.
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"Holding your investments expecting growth, or selling and taking profit now."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,There isnt really anything this interaction reminds me of. Its a simple game of trusting a random person. I cant trust this person to pass the tokens back and do not want to end losing more than I should have.
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I think this sounds like conservation interests. The TragedyoftheCommons exhibits how natural resources can be completely depleted if everyone is selfish about their use of it. This interaction, to me, is a reminder that everyone can benefit if we are a little less selfish. "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction is like when you and a friend decide whether to share snacks. Do you keep all the goodies for yourself and be a jerk or share them equally? It's a bit like deciding between being a snack hog or a snack superhero! It shows how important it is to think about both your own happiness and your friend's. Sharing is caring, after all!"
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"I think its a great win win situation. It reminds me of how you get a paycheck, you share some of the pay with others and it ends up coming back in other ways. In other words, a sowing and reaping scenario taking place. I wish all would consider this idea and give a small amount. I see people on social media who NEED help and iknow that if each of us only offered 5 dollars. that one person could (insert need resolution). But sadly, seems like people don't get that whole ""community"" concept. Yet, seems like everyone talks a big talk. "
Male,b,BCG,Hold,"I would say that it represents selfnishness and a morality mentality. If both members value each other winnning then the choice is simple, if one values themself more than the other then their choice is simple also. I believe the anonymous component is where this really comes into play."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,I think this situation  is a situation  of trust. It is like most things you can do your part but you can't  make the decisions  of others. It is very much like life.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of people pooling their resources together to buy something larger or save for a goal. Usually one person is entrusted with the money, and they need to be trusted to not just take it all for themselves. It also is similar in that when everyone is sharing, everyone benefits more."
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"I don't know what you mean by that, nothing in my life has anything to do with giving someone something and,or getting something back  or trying to make something that gets something I have no ideas about that,,and I don't know what happens in people's lives that is anything close to this game"
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think that this one is a study to see the psychology behind delayed gratification. I don't have anything similar to this in my life (except maybe putting money investments) that would be similar. It seems like a mix between investing and impulse control.
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"This interaction reminds me of survival of the fittest. You can't always expect others to look out for you, and so sometimes, you have to do what will guarantee a positive outcome for you. If you put your own fate in someone else's hands, you're not always going to get what you expect."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,This play reminds me of greed. In the game if player A passes to player B then  player A gets nothing and player B gets 20. What doesn't make sense is why player A would pass to player B knowing they would get nothing. It could be a trust issue as well.
Male,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of whether people will be selfish even when they are well off thanks to receiving money from someone els, like a gift. Will they be willing to return the gift for a small price or will they simply hold on to their own gift? Of course, gifts don√¢¬Ä¬ôt grow, but in this case, the growing thing would be the intrinsic affection and relationship."
Male,a,BCG,Hold,"Seems like a test on cooperation and sharing resources. I can't really think of a real world situation I encounter this kind of choice, I apologize."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,This scenario brings onboard options available to individuals to either trust each other or pursue self-gain. The choices to either hold or return represents either temporary gains or possible long-term benefits. This very much simulates the complexiites of choices in the economical and social worlds
Female,b,BCG,Pass,"It reminds me of the fact that my actions affect or have consequences on others. In my opinion, it attempts to highlight the effects of investments and the potential returns that it could accrue and what it means to not invest."
Male,b,BCG,Hold,I tried to maximize the mutual outputs for both of us.   Person A put some trust in me to benefit us both so I took the opportunity to pass so we would both end up the same.
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"This interaction makes me think of how people are confronted with many situations in daily life in which we choose or choose not to place trust in others. I think that the decision that participants are asked to make in this game about whether to hold or to pass will be mainly determined by their belief in how trustworthy people are in general. I feel that most people usually try to √¢¬Ä¬údo the right thing√¢¬Ä¬ù and want to be helpful and generous to at least a certain extent This is why I chose to √¢¬Ä¬úpass√¢¬Ä¬ù in the game, based on the hope that my counterpart will also pass and both of us will receive increased earnings as a result."
Female,a,BCG,Pass,"It's obviously related to the prison game, & if I just disallowed myself from the whole survey, oh well. I always try to go for the move that makes the most equitable result more likely to happen, because that's how I live my life in general."
Male,a,BCG,Pass,I think it is trying to capture the act of making an investment and whether that investment goes well or not.
Female,b,BCG,Hold,"This interaction dmust be about ethics. I'm not often in situations where I'm having to split money with a person or basically make a ""you or me"" decision to be honest. It reminds me of game shows  that come on tv like survivor or goldenballs where they can either get something their team needs or a nice meal or shower for themselves."
Female,b,BCG,Hold,I think this was trying to capture life and how to grow in any way. If you are selfish you gain nothing. When you are generous then it will come back to you with more than you gave out.
